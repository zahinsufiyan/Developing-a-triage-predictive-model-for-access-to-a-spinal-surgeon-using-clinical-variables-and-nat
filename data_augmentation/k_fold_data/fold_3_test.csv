Axial T2 and 3-D MEDIC.     COMPARISON: No previous     FINDINGS:  There is focal mild reversal of the mid cervical lordosis centered at the C5 level.  Vertebral body height appears preserved aside from mild superior endplate compression/degeneration at C6 and to minimal extent suspected at C7 as well.  Background marrow signal is unremarkable.  No convincing signal changes identified within the spinal cord.  No myelomalacia is suspected, but there is some mild compression as discussed below.       Above C4: There is mild disc desiccation but disc height is preserved.  No significant spondylosis is seen in the spinal canal and intervertebral foramina are widely patent.     C4-5: There is disc desiccation with mild anterior disc height loss and endplate degeneration.  No further spondylosis noted.  Spinal canal and intervertebral foramina widely patent.     C5-6: There is moderate degenerative disc disease with height loss and endplate change.  Moderate posterior disc osteophyte complex formation is present and extends to the uncovertebral joints, overall larger on the left side.  This results in mild spinal stenosis with effacement of the CSF in the thecal sac and with mild indentation of the spinal cord, more so on the left.  There is foraminal narrowing from the uncovertebral osteophytes to moderate to severe degree on the left and moderate degree on the right, and this may result in clinically significant exiting C6 nerve root impingement.     C6-7: There is disc desiccation with mild to moderate disc height loss.  Mild endplate degeneration is seen.  Mild posterior central focal disc protrusion is seen and mildly indents the thecal sac.  Moderate uncovertebral osteophytosis is seen bilaterally but is worse on the left.  The left foramen is moderately narrowed in the right foramen is mildly narrowed.  Minimal/mild narrowing of the spinal canal is less pronounced than at the C5-6 level.     C7-T4: There is mild disc desiccation at multiple levels but no significant disc height loss is seen.  Mild calcification of the posterior longitudinal ligament mildly encroaches upon the spinal canal and indents the thecal sac but does not appear to result in significant overall spinal stenosis.  Foramina appear widely patent.     IMPRESSION: There is considerable degenerative spondylosis at the C5-C7 levels, particularly C5-6.  There is associated degenerative disc height loss and endplate change as well as posterior disc bulging and herniation and uncovertebral osteophytosis.  This results in mild spinal stenosis at C5-6 with mild indentation of the spinal cord.  No myelomalacia noted.  Moderate to severe left C5-6 foraminal narrowing is seen, and to lesser moderate degree on the right at C5-6 more than on the left at C6-7.  Mild right C6-7 foraminal narrowing.

Query nerve impingement due to  significant scoliosis.  TECHNIQUE: Routine lumbar spine protocol.  FINDINGS:  Upper lumbar scoliosis with convexity left and lower lumbar scoliosis with convexity to  the right. There is also minor left lateral listhesis of L3 on L4. This results in distortion  of the lumbar spine anatomy.  The vertebral body heights are maintained. Intervertebral discs are dehydrated  throughout the lumbar spine.  L1-2: Mild posterior disc bulging. Some minor predominantly right-sided vertebral  osteophytes. Minor narrowing of the right neural foramen. Exiting nerve root does not  appear impinged. The left neural foramen is unremarkable.  L2-3: Right-sided intervertebral disc space narrowing with right-sided vertebral  osteophyte formation. Osteophytes results in some minor encroachment towards the  inferior aspect of the right neural foramen. Exiting nerve root is in close proximity to the  vertebral osteophytes. There may be potential for nerve root irritation.  The left neural foramen remains patent. There is some minimal generalized disc bulging. This does not result in any  compromise of the thecal sac. MRI LUMBAR SPINE  L3-4: Intervertebral disc space narrowing predominantly along the right lateral aspect  with right-sided vertebral osteophyte formation. Mild right-sided disc bulging is also  present which encroaches into the inferior aspect of the neural foramen and contacts  the exiting right L3 nerve root.  The exiting left L3 nerve root does not appear compressed.  L4-5: Predominantly left-sided disc space narrowing with prominent left-sided vertebral  osteophyte formation. There is mild generalized disc bulging slightly more prominent  on the left side with the disc and osteophytes encroach into the neural foramen. There  is effacement of the fat surrounding the exiting left L4 nerve root. This has potential for  nerve root irritation.  The right neural foramen remains capacious.  L5-S1: Mild narrowing of the intervertebral disc space. The left neural foramen  demonstrates narrowing with partial effacement of the fat surrounding the exiting L5  nerve root. This has potential for nerve root symptoms. The right neural foramen are  maintained.  L2-3 mild right-sided facet joint osteoarthritis.

I note that the patient has a history of a left-sided disc herniation.     TECHNICAL:     Sagittal and axial T1 and T2-weighted sequences were performed.     FINDINGS:     This report assumes five lumbar-type vertebrae.  A curvature is present convex to the right which may in part be related to patient positioning.  The vertebral body heights are well maintained.  The bone marrow signal is fairly homogeneous allowing for hemangiomata/fatty rests as well as degenerative endplate changes.  The conus medullaris terminates normally at approximately the L1 level.     At the S1/2 level, an underdeveloped disc is noted.  No significant neural foraminal compromise or compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.     At the L5/S1 level, at least moderate degenerative endplate changes are present along with moderate-to-advanced narrowing of the intervertebral disc.  A small amount of vacuum phenomenon is suspected within the intervertebral disc.  Mild disc/osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline, which extends laterally protruding into the inferior aspect of the neural foramen bilaterally.  The posterior disc/osteophyte complex appears to abut but not significantly displace or compress the traversing S1 nerve root bilaterally.

231,"CLINICAL HISTORY: MRI lumbar spine for persistent low back pain with LEFT sciatica.  Query disc lesion.  PROTOCOL: Routine lumbar spine with sagittal T2, sagittal T1 and axial T2  sequences.  COMPARISON: No prior MRI study for comparison. Reference to CT abdomen and  pelvis dated April 18, 2015.  FINDINGS:  Five lumbar type vertebral bodies demonstrate straightening of the normal lumbar  lordosis which can be seen in the setting of muscle spasm or may relate to patient  positioning. For the purposes of this report, the lowest free vertebral body is labeled L5.  Small oval focus of T1 and T2 hyperintense signal in the LEFT pedicle at L5 and a tiny  punctate focus of T1 and T2 hyperintense signal in the RIGHT pedicle of L5 are most  consistent with small benign hemangiomas. No evidence of pars defects on today's  study or on the prior CT abdomen and pelvis study of 2015. Multilevel Schmorl's nodes.  Bone marrow signal is otherwise unremarkable.  The conus terminates normally at T12-L1.  No concerning extraspinal abnormality within the limitations of this nondedicated study.  T12-L1: Disc space is preserved. No significant central spinal canal or neuroforaminal  stenosis (assessed on sagittal images only).  L1-L2: Disc space is preserved. No significant central spinal canal or neuroforaminal  stenosis (assessed on sagittal images only).  L2-3: Disc desiccation with mild disc space narrowing and minimal circumferential disc  bulge. No significant central spinal canal or neuroforaminal stenosis (assessed on  sagittal images only) L3-4: Disc desiccation with mild disc space narrowing and minimal disc circumferential  disc bulge which effaces the anterior thecal sac and contacts the traversing nerve roots  with no evidence of nerve root impingement. Mild bilateral facet osteoarthritis. No  significant central spinal canal or neuroforaminal stenosis.  L4-5: Minimal circumferential disc bulge which effaces the anterior thecal sac and  contacts the traversing nerve roots. Moderate bilateral facet osteoarthritis with  hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum. No significant central spinal canal stenosis. Mild  bilateral neuroforaminal stenosis. No evidence of nerve root impingement.  L5-S1: Disc desiccation with mild to moderate disc space narrowing. There is a focal  disc protrusion, centered in the central-LEFT subarticular zones, measuring up to 0.7cm  AP x 2.0 cm TR x 0.8 cm CC. This contacts the traversing LEFT S1 nerve root which is  posteriorly displaced and appears thickened at this level. Nerve root impingement is  suspected. Otherwise, no significant central spinal canal stenosis. Moderate to severe  bilateral facet osteoarthritis. This results in moderate bilateral neuroforaminal stenosis,  LEFT greater than RIGHT. There may be impingement of the exiting nerve roots.  IMPRESSION:  Multilevel vertebral spondylosis and facet osteoarthritis, as detailed above.

Vertebral body heights are preserved. There are multilevel mild to moderate   degenerative endplate changes with loss of intervertebral disc heights in association. Scattered vertebral body hemangiomata   noted.       At T9/10, there is a focal partially calcified posterior disc extrusion measuring 8 mm AP and up to 15 mm transverse. Extruded   disc material measures 13 mm in total craniocaudal dimension, extending approximately 5 mm superior to the inferior T9 endplate   and approximately 4 mm inferior to the superior T10 endplate. This causes posterior displacement and anterior   flattening/indentation of the spinal cord with subtle increased intrasubstance cord T2 signal at this level. The central canal   measures 6 mm AP at the level of the extrusion.       There are further shallower posterior disc protrusions seen elsewhere within the thoracic spine. At T5/6, there is a right   parasagittal broad-based disc protrusion which just indents the right anterolateral margin of the cord and causes mild leftward   deviation of the cord without any convincing intrinsic cord signal abnormality at this level. This disc protrusion measures 8 mm   AP and extends superior to the inferior T5 endplate by approximately 6 mm. Further shallow noncompressive posterior disc   protrusions at T7/T8 and T2/T3 noted.       No significant central canal stenosis demonstrated elsewhere throughout the thoracic spine. No significant thoracic neural   foraminal stenosis.       The remainder of the imaged spinal cord and conus medullaris is unremarkable.       CONCLUSION:    Prominent central disc extrusion at T9/10 causing significant central canal stenosis, flattening/indentation of the spinal cord   and subtle localized intrinsic cord signal abnormality as described, compatible with myelopathic change at this level. A spinal   surgical consult is advised for further management.       Degenerative changes and further noncompressive disc protrusions elsewhere throughout the thoracic spine as described.         ",0

History of osteoarthritis of the  spine.  Worsening pain.  Discitis?     TECHNIQUE: Sagittal and axial T1 and axial and sagittal T2 sequences were acquired without gadolinium.  After gadolinium, axial  and sagittal T1 fat saturation sequences were obtained.     COMPARISON: MRI of the spine dated November 2, 2009.     FINDINGS:     5 lumbar type vertebrae.  There is mild anterior compression of the T12 vertebra, unchanged compared to a CT scan from June 29,  2017.  Vertebral body heights are otherwise maintained.  Generalized marrow signal is preserved.  Alignment of the spine is  normal. The conus terminates at L1-L2.     At L1-L2 there is mild desiccation of the disc with no significant protrusion.  There is mild bilateral facet joint arthropathy  and ligamentum flavum thickening.  Changes result in no significant spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis.     At L2-L3 there is desiccation of the disc and mild broad-based disc protrusion, asymmetric to the right.  There is also mild  bilateral facet joint arthropathy and ligamentum flavum thickening.  A very small synovial cyst extends medially from the left  facet joint measuring approximately 0.4 x 0.6 cm.  Changes result in moderate spinal canal stenosis with preserved CSF signal  interspersed between the nerve roots.  There is also moderate bilateral neural foraminal stenosis, worse on the right.     At L3-L4 there is desiccation of the disc with broad-based disc protrusion and a superimposed right central/subarticular disc  extrusion that migrates superiorly by approximately 1.4 cm.  Enhancement around the protruded disc is likely related to  granulation tissue.  Mild bilateral facet joint arthropathy and ligament of flavum thickening are also present at this level.  Changes result in moderate spinal canal stenosis.  There is effacement of the right lateral recess and apparent impingement of the  descending right L4 nerve root.  There is severe right and moderate left neural foraminal stenosis.  There are degenerative  changes between the spinous processes of L3 and L4.     At L4-L5 there is broad-based disc protrusion, moderate bilateral facet joint arthropathy and ligamentum flavum thickening.  Changes result in moderate spinal canal stenosis with preserved CSF signal interspersed between the nerve roots.  There is  moderate right and moderate to severe left neural foraminal stenosis. There are degenerative changes between the spinous processes  of L4 and L5.     At L5-S1 there is desiccation of the disc with slight broad-based disc protrusion.  Mild bilateral facet joint arthropathy is  present, worse on the right.  Changes result in no significant spinal canal stenosis.

Degenerative changes as described above with moderate spinal canal stenoses at  L2-L3, L3-L4 and L4-L5.  There is a right central/subarticular disc extrusion at L3-L4 with associated enhancing granulation  tissue causing effacement of the right lateral recess and impingement of the descending right L4 nerve root.

No abnormality of signal or contour is identified within the distal cord or conus. Vertebral alignment is well maintained. Intervertebral disc spaces are well maintained. The intervertebral discs within the lower thoracic and upper lumbar spine as far distally as and including the L3-4 level, there is no disc bulge present. The spinal canal caliber is well maintained. Neural foramina are well maintained. There is no nerve root impingement. Facet joints are unremarkable.     At L4-5 level, there is mild decrease in T2 signal indicating early disc desiccation. There is a broad-based posterior disc protrusion which causes indentation upon the anterior aspect of the thecal sac. There is mild hypertrophy of ligamentum flavum at this level and these features produce mild spinal canal stenosis. In particular, there is some significant narrowing of the lateral recesses, more prominent on the left than on the right. This may cause some impingement upon the traversing L5 nerve roots. The disc bulge at this level produces some mild stenosis of the inferior aspects of the left neural foramen and some moderate stenosis of the right neural foramen in the absence of any nerve root impingement.     At the L5-S1 level, there is decreased T2 signal within the intervertebral disc indicating disc desiccation. There is a small broad-based posterior disc bulge which is slightly more prominent to the right of the midline. The disc bulge contains a tiny annular tear. The disc bulge does not cause any significant spinal stenosis. The neural foramina are mildly narrowed bilaterally in the absence of any direct nerve root impingement. There is some mild degenerative change within the facet joints.     CONCLUSION: There is disc degeneration at the L4-5 and L5-S1 levels. At the L4-5 level, disc bulge produces some narrowing of the spinal canal caliber and in particular, of the lateral recesses. There is potential for impingement upon the bilateral traversing L5 nerve roots. At the L5-S1 level, a small broad-based posterior disc bulge contains a tiny annular tear. There is mild degenerative change within the L5-S1 facet joints.     The Workers' Compensation Board has requested that we provide a professional opinion as to whether the imaging findings are related whole or in part to the injury in question.

520,"Technique: Routine lumbar spine MR was performed.     Comparison with April 9, 2019.     FINDINGS:     Five lumbar type vertebrae were confirmed on prior radiographs. Mild degenerative anterolisthesis of L4 on L5 and L5 on S1 is similar to previous. There is unchanged mild superior endplate depression at L5 without marrow edema. Vertebral body heights elsewhere are maintained. The conus medullaris is normally positioned at the L2 level. There is endplate spurring at L1-L2 and L4-L5. Small round T1 and T2 hyperintense vertebral body foci at T10 and L3 most likely represent benign lesions such as fatty rests and/or hemangiomas.

No central canal compromise   visualized.  There is mild narrowing of the left neural foramen.  Right neural foramen is patent.       C5-6: The intervertebral disc space is maintained.  Asymmetric disc osteophytic bulge identified posterior laterally on the left   with mild degenerative uncovertebral joint changes on the left result in very mild narrowing of the left neural foramen.  Right   neural foramen is patent.  No central canal compromise identified.       C6-7: The intervertebral disc space is maintained.  There does appear to be a more focal disc protrusion/extrusion in a right   paracentral location.  The posterior longitudinal ligament appears to be expanded and is widened in the AP dimension from the   level of the top of C6 2 the upper third of the C7 vertebral body posteriorly.  This produces a convexity which indents the   anterior aspect of the cervical cord at the C6-7 level.  There is tapering of the cord at this level as well as some altered   increased T2 signal identified within.       C7-T1: The intervertebral disc spaces maintained.  No central canal or neural foraminal compromise identified.       IMPRESSION: Slightly unusual appearance identified at C6-7 where there does appear to be a focal disc protrusion in a left   paracentral location.  I suspect that there is a small defect in the posterior longitudinal ligament allowing the focal herniation  to extend into/through the ligament with further extrusion in a superior and inferior direction at the posterior aspect of the   posterior longitudinal ligament this results in a posterior convexity indenting the cervical cord resulting in deformation of the   cord and some signal change within the substance of the cord in keeping with high-grade central canal stenosis.  Recommend urgent   neurosurgical opinion.    Alternatively, although much less likely, this could represent a focal disc as well as a intra-axial   lesion such as a meningioma.  An enhanced study may help in further clarification.       Asymmetric disc ossific bulges identified posterior A on the left at C4-5 C5-6 which results in mild narrowing of the left neural  foramina at these levels.",0

Bone marrow signal appears to be within normal limits aside from multilevel endplate  degenerative changes.  At C2-C3 there is no significant degenerative disease or spinal canal stenosis. Neural  foramen appear patent.  At C3-C4 there is severe degenerative disease with posterior disc osteophyte which  causes at least moderate spinal canal stenosis at this level. There is mass effect upon  the cervical cord at this level with mild AP flattening of the cervical cord. There is no  evidence of cord signal change at this level. There is severe RIGHT and moderate to  severe LEFT neuroforaminal stenosis related to uncovertebral joint and facet joint  OA/hypertrophy.

682,"TECHNIQUE:  Routine lumbar spine sequences with axial T1/T2 sequences from L3-S1 and a further  axial T2 sequence from T12-L3.  CORRELATION:  Comparison is made with the x-rays dated June 15, 2020, and with the MRI dated  August 20, 2017.  FINDINGS:  The lowest complete lumbar disc space is defined as L5-S1 for the purposes of this  report.  There is a slight straightening of the natural lumbar lordosis potentially due to an  element of muscle spasm. Lumbar vertebral height and alignment are otherwise  preserved. No fractures. No spondylolisthesis. There is degenerative disc disease at  L4-5 as detailed below. The remaining lumbar discs are reasonably well preserved,  although there are some prominent anterior endplate osteophytes at L3-4 and smaller  endplate osteophytes at the other lumbar levels.  The conus medullaris lies at L1.  DISCS:  T12-L1 - Minor broad-based posterior disc bulge. No spinal canal or neural foraminal  stenosis.  L1-2 - Normal disc. No spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis.  L2-3 - Normal disc. No spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis.  L3-4 - Normal disc. No spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis. Prominent anterior endplate osteophytes on the left side.  L4-5 - Disc desiccation with mild loss of disc height and a small posterior annular tear.  There is a small broad-based posterior disc bulge. There are severe bilateral facet joint  degenerative changes. There is a 6 mm ovoid lesion at the medial aspect of the right  L4-5 facet joint extending into the lateral recess, likely representing a synovial cyst,  although there is no significant fluid signal. There are congenitally shortened pedicles.  The combination of these findings is resulting in severe spinal stenosis with some  effacement of the posterior epidural fat. There is mild buckling of the cauda equina  proximal to this. There is severe bilateral lateral recess stenosis with impingement on  the descending L5 nerve roots bilaterally. There is mild right neural foraminal  narrowing without exiting nerve root impingement.  L5-S1 - Normal disc. No spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis. Mild bilateral facet  joint degenerative changes.  Other: There is a large exophytic cyst arising from the lower pole of the left kidney,  measuring approximately 7.2 cm in diameter. Probable small exophytic cyst in the  interpolar region of the right kidney.  OPINION:  1. Severe spinal stenosis at L4-5 secondary to a small broad-based posterior  disc bulge, severe facet joint arthropathy and a new 6 mm right L4-5 facet joint  synovial cyst extending into the right lateral recess. The appearances represent a deterioration from the previous MRI.  2. Mild degenerative changes elsewhere within the lumbar spine, but no further  evidence of significant disc bulges, spinal stenosis or neural foraminal stenosis.  3. Large exophytic cyst arising from the lower pole of the left kidney",1

807,"Findings:  Â   Direct comparison is made with the prior lumbar MRI of 2017.  Â   Identification of the L5 segment is defined by the location of the iliolumbar ligament.  Â   A normal conus medullaris terminates at L1 .  Â   Multilevel spondylosis and moderate-to-severe degenerative disc disease are again seen.  This has progressed in some levels.  Â   Degenerative bone marrow signal change is evident in multiple levels.  No other significant abnormality of bone marrow signal is seen.  Â   Central canal is reduced in two levels as discussed below.  Â   In T11-12, a chronic broad posterior disc-osteophyte complex results in mild central stenosis with some distortion of cord and thecal sac contour.  This may be the etiology of the thoracic myelopathy described on the history for the 2017 MRI request.  However, cord signal remains normal, showing no edema or evidence for myelomalacia.  The mild stenosis appears relatively stable.  Â   In T12-L1 and in L1-2, minor broad posterior disc bulges are stable, causing no neural compromise.  The facet joints show minor degenerative change without definite osteoarthritis.  Â   In L2-3, severe disc degeneration has nearly obliterated the intervertebral disc, representing a significant adverse change from 2017 when the disc was near normal.  There is minor retrolisthesis.  A broad posterior disc bulge associated with the disc degeneration is slightly eccentric towards the right side.  There is now mild central stenosis, with slight distortion in the thecal sac contour.  However, no convincing nerve root compromise is seen, as perineural fat is still preserved bilaterally with respect to exiting and descending nerves.  Mild/moderate osteoarthritis of the bilateral facet joints is present.  Â   Previously seen fluid between spinous processes of L2 and L3 has resolved, leaving advanced degenerative change.  Â   L3-4 remains stable.  A broad posterior disc bulge slightly indents the ventral thecal sac but does not cause any convincing neural compromise.  Previously suggested mild central stenosis shows no adverse change.  Moderately severe bilateral facet OA is evident.  Â   L4-5 is stable.  The broad posterior disc bulge indents the ventral thecal sac but does not cause convincing neural compromise.  The previously described mild bilateral foraminal stenosis shows no progression.  Perineural fat is still preserved.  Severe bilateral facet OA is again evident, with minimal degenerative grade 1 anterolisthesis which was previously present.  Â   L5-S1 is stable.  The minimal broad posterior disc bulge barely touches the thecal sac because of the capacious size of the central canal in this level.  Neural elements remain fully intact with no compromise.  Severe bilateral facet OA is again seen.  Â   Impression:  Â   Multilevel degenerative disc disease and spondylosis are again seen.  The only adverse change from 2017 is the development of new severe degenerative disc disease in L2-3 which was previously near normal.  Â   The above produces a new level of mild central stenosis.  Â   Prior mild central stenosis in T11-T12 remains stable; while there may still be mild cord compression, the cord does not show any edema or evidence of myelomalacia.  Clinical correlation is required regarding any persistence of the thoracic myelopathy clinically described in 2017.  Â   Again no other potential neural compromise is seen on this study, and there is no specific site of convincing nerve root compromise.  Â   Moderate to severe facet OA is present in most levels.",1

Small to moderate-sized anterolateral osteophytes at several levels, most prominently on the left at L2-3. Incidental intraosseous hemangioma within the T11 vertebral body measuring 18 mm craniocaudal.  Â   Visualized lower thoracic spinal cord and conus medullaris are unremarkable. Conus tip is situated at the L1-2 level.  Â   At T10-11, there is mild loss of disc height and minor annular disc bulging. No nerve root impingement or spinal stenosis. Minor narrowing of the neural foramina.  Â   At T11-12, there is moderate loss of disc height. A small posterior disc bulge does not compress the conus medullaris. Mild narrowing of the right neural foramen. No stenosis of the left neural foramen. No spinal stenosis.  Â   At T12-L1, mild annular disc bulging noted. No conus or nerve root impingement, spinal stenosis or neural foraminal stenosis.  Â   At L1-2, there is moderate loss of disc height. A small posterior disc-osteophyte complex indents the thecal sac. No nerve root impingement or spinal stenosis. Mild stenosis of the left neural foramen. No significant right neural foraminal narrowing.  Â   At L2-3, there is moderate loss of disc height. A broad-based disc-osteophyte complex indents the thecal sac but does not cause any focal nerve root impingement. Slight narrowing of both lateral recesses but no spinal stenosis. Mild stenoses of both neural foramina. Facet joints are obscured by artifact from the instrumentation.  Â   Posterior laminectomies have been performed at the L3 and L4 levels.
