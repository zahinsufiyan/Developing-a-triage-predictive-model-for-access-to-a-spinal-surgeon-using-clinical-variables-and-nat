4,"MR LUMBAR SPINE       Reason for Exam: PROGRESSIVELY WORSENING RT SIDED LOWER BACK AND RT LEG BURNING PAIN      TECHNICAL: Routine sagittal and axial T1 and T2.     COMPARISON: Radiographs December 3, 2012     FINDINGS:       There are 4 nonrib-bearing lumbar type vertebra.       Lumbar alignment is normal.       Marrow signal is normal aside from mild discogenic endplate signal change       The visualized portion of the spinal cord is normal in signal and morphology.  The conus appears to terminate at the L1 level.     There is mild lumbar epidural lipomatosis with prominent fat noted at L2, L3-L4 and S1      Visualized extraspinal structures are unremarkable.     At L1-2 and the superior visualized levels there is no significant spinal canal or neuroforaminal stenosis.     L2-L3: Loss of disc height with marginal disc osteophyte complex, and mild epidural lipomatosis.  Mild foraminal stenosis.  There is moderate effacement of the left lateral recess by disc material.  No significant central zone spinal canal stenosis     L3-L4: Loss of disc height with marginal disc osteophyte complex, and epidural lipomatosis.  Mild narrowing of the thecal sac.  Mild effacement of the lateral recesses.  Mild foraminal stenosis.     L4-S1: Loss of disc height with marginal disc osteophyte complex, and epidural lipomatosis.  Disc osteophyte complex is present eccentric to the right involving the right paracentral and foraminal zones and extending far laterally.  Small central zone annular tear is present.  There is no significant central zone spinal canal stenosis.  There is no significant effacement of the left lateral recess or significant left foraminal stenosis.  There is moderate right foraminal stenosis.  The expected right L5 nerve root is contacted far laterally by disc osteophyte complex.

42,"Reason for Exam: SHE HAS SPINAL STENOSIS AND RADICULOPATHY. SHE IS KNOWN WITH CP. SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO GO FOR BACK SURGERY IN 2017. BUT SHE GOT SICK. ?SPINAL STENOSIS      HISTORY:  As above.     TECHNIQUE:  Standard radiculopathy protocol, consisting of sagittal T1 and T2 imaging from T9 to the upper sacrum and axial T1 and T2 imaging from L3-4 to L5-S1.     FINDINGS:  Comparison made to the MR lumbar spine from April 26, 2016 (Grey Nuns Hospital). Lumbar spine x-rays performed December 5, 2016 (St. Paul HCC) and CT abdomen/pelvis from August 27, 2018 (Cold Lake HCC) were also reviewed.     Five lumbar vertebrae are assumed. Moderate curvature of the lumbar spine convex right centered at L3-4. Vertebral body heights are maintained. No focal destructive osseous lesions.     The lower thoracic spinal cord and conus medullaris are suboptimally assessed due to motion artifact. They appear grossly normal in caliber. Conus terminates in a normal fashion at the L1 level. No fatty filum terminale.     Hypointense T2 signal noted within most of the lower thoracic and lumbar discs, indicative of underlying disc degeneration.     Similar tiny posterior disc protrusions are present at the T9-10, T10-11 and T11-12 levels, indenting the thecal sac but not affecting the spinal cord or nerve roots. No spinal stenosis or significant neural foraminal narrowing at these levels.     At T12-L1, disc height is preserved. Mild annular disc bulging is present. No nerve root impingement, spinal stenosis or neural foraminal stenosis. Minor facet degenerative changes.     At L1-2, there is similar subtle retrolisthesis of L1 on L2. Mild loss of disc height eccentrically towards the right. A small right paracentral disc-osteophyte complex indents the thecal sac but does not affect the conus. Moderate stenosis of the right neural foramen noted. No stenosis of the left neural foramen. No spinal stenosis. Minor facet degenerative changes. Appearances are not significantly changed.     At L2-3, disc height is reasonably well-maintained. A small broad-based posterior disc-osteophyte complex indents the ventral thecal sac and encroaches upon the inferior aspects of both neural foramina, resulting in bilateral neural foraminal stenoses of mild to moderate severity. Mild to moderate left-sided and minor right-sided facet degenerative changes. Slight narrowing of the left lateral recess. No stenosis of the right lateral recess. No spinal stenosis. Appearances are not significantly changed.     At L3-4, there remains moderate loss of disc height laterally towards the left with associated moderately advanced degenerative endplate changes. Moderate left-sided and mild right-sided facet degenerative changes and mild ligamentum flavum thickening also noted. A small broad-based disc-osteophyte complex indents the ventral thecal sac. Moderate stenosis of the left lateral recess and moderate to severe narrowing of the left neural foramen noted. Minor narrowing of the right neural foramen. Right lateral recess remains normal in caliber. No significant spinal stenosis. Appearances overall are not significantly changed.     At L4-5, disc height is well-maintained. Bilateral moderate to severe facet degenerative changes are present with ligamentum flavum thickening. A small broad-based posterior disc-osteophyte complex indents the ventral thecal sac. A 6 mm circumscribed focus of hyperintense T1 and T2 signal situated along the anteromedial aspect of the right facet joint is unchanged. This corresponds to a either a small focus of ossification or calcified synovial cyst on the CT scan, contributing to moderate to severe right lateral recess stenosis. There is mild transverse narrowing of the thecal sac posteriorly. No significant left lateral recess narrowing. Mild stenoses of both neural foramina. Appearances overall are similar to the prior MR study.     At L5-S1, there is grade 1-2 spondylolisthesis of 6 mm, worse compared to the 2016 study. Disc height is reasonably well-maintained. There is unroofing of the posterior disc margin, with a small shallow disc bulge indenting the ventral thecal sac. There is severe degeneration of the left facet joint, with severe joint space narrowing and adjacent sclerosis and bony overgrowth evident. Moderate degeneration of the right facet joint also noted. Unilateral right-sided spondylolysis of L5 is again evident. Combination of these findings results in bilateral lateral recess stenoses of at least moderate severity and moderate spinal stenosis. There is severe stenosis of the right neural foramen with virtually complete effacement of the perineural fat and compression and flattening of the exiting right L5 nerve root. Moderate to severe stenosis of the left neural foramen also noted.     Mild degenerative changes noted within the visualized sacroiliac joints. Prevertebral soft tissues are unremarkable.     OPINION:  1. Spondylolisthesis of L5 on S1 is slightly worse compared to the 2016 MR examination. Anterolisthesis is secondary to a combination of right L5 spondylolysis and bilateral facet degeneration. Facet degeneration is severe on the left side. There is severe stenosis of the right L5-S1 neural foramen with compression of the exiting right L5 nerve root. Moderate to severe stenosis of the left neural foramen, bilateral lateral recess stenoses of moderate severity and moderate spinal stenosis at this level also.     2. Multilevel degenerative disc disease in the remainder of the spine is of similar severity, as detailed above. Moderate to severe stenosis of the right lateral recess at L4-5 secondary to a combination of disc degeneration, facet degeneration and small focus of ossification (or synovial cyst with peripheral calcification) at the anteromedial aspect of the right facet joint. Spinal stenosis of moderate severity at L4-5 also.",0

Sagittal T1 and sagittal T2-weighted imaging of the lumbar spine was also performed with axial T1/T2 weighted imaging from L3 to S1.     FINDINGS:     MRI CERVICAL SPINE:  There is normal alignment of the vertebral bodies and facet joints with no significant loss in vertebral body height.     No definite abnormal T2 high signal is demonstrated within the cervical spine.     2/3: No significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing.     C3/4: No significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing.     C4/5: No significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing.     C5/6: Minimal disc osteophyte complex is noted with no significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing.     C6/7: No significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing.     C7/T1: No significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing.     12 x 9 mm T2 hyperintense focus within the subcutaneous soft tissue of the back on the left at the level of C6/7 may represent a sebaceous cyst.     MRI LUMBAR SPINE:  5 lumbar-type vertebrae are noted.  Fatty endplate degenerative changes are noted at L4/5.  Concave-like depression of the inferior endplate of L5 is unchanged dating back to the CT study of February 2008.  There is otherwise normal alignment of the vertebral bodies and facet joints with no other significant loss in vertebral body height.     The conus medullaris terminates at the level of T12/L1 and is within normal limits in appearance.     No significant degenerative disc changes, spinal canal narrowing or neural foraminal narrowing at T12/L1, L1/2, or L2/3.     L3/4: Disc protrusion is noted centered to the left of the midline indenting the thecal sac with moderate compression of the thecal sac.  The left traversing L4 nerve root is being contacted and appears to be getting flattened against the ligamentum flavum.  No significant neural foraminal narrowing.     L4/5: Disc bulge is noted with a broad-based posterior disc protrusion that is contacting the traversing L5 nerve roots, left greater than right.  Mild spinal canal narrowing is noted with no significant neural foraminal narrowing.     L5/S1: Small broad-based posterior disc protrusion is noted centered to the right of the midline minimally contacting the traversing S1 nerve roots.  No significant spinal canal narrowing.  Posterolateral osteophytosis is contributing to mild neural foraminal narrowing.     Fetal lobulations may account for the slightly lobulated appearance of the left kidney on the localizer images.  This can be confirmed with ultrasound.     IMPRESSION:  Degenerative changes within the lumbar spine as described above.  At L3/4, disc protrusion is resulting in moderate compression of the thecal sac and the left traversing L4 nerve root appears to be getting flattened against the ligamentum flavum.  At L4/5, the traversing L5 nerve roots are being contacted, left greater than right, with mild spinal canal narrowing overall.  At L5/S1, minimal contact of the traversing S1 nerve roots is noted with mild neural foraminal narrowing.     No significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing is demonstrated within the cervical spine.     Fetal lobulations may account for the slightly lobulated appearance of the left kidney on the localizer images.  Correlation with ultrasound is recommended.     12 x 9 mm T2 hyperintense focus within the subcutaneous soft tissue of the back on the left at the level of C6/7 may represent a sebaceous cyst.   ",1

QUERY NERVE IMPINGEMENT IN LUMBAR SPINE.     Radiographs of the lumbar spine performed June 27, 2018 are available for comparison.     A clinical history of ""right-sided radicular pain"" has been provided.     TECHNICAL:     Sagittal and axial T1- and T2-weighted sequences were performed.     FINDINGS:     This report assumes five lumbar-type vertebrae.  At least a moderate curvature is present convex to the left, centered at the L2/3 level.  The accompanying radiographs demonstrate that the L3 vertebral body is subluxed to the left with respect to the L4 vertebral body which measures approximately 1 cm.  The vertebral body heights are relatively well-maintained.  The bone marrow signal is unremarkable allowing for hemangiomata/fatty rests, as well as degenerative endplate changes at multiple levels.  The conus medullaris terminates normally at approximately the level of the T12/L1 intervertebral disc.     At the L5/S1 level, the intervertebral disc is unremarkable.  Degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints, moderate on the left and mild on the right.  No significant neural foraminal compromise or compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.     At the L4/5 level, degenerative endplate changes are present, more prominent eccentric to the left.  Narrowing of the intervertebral disc is present, advanced on the left and minimal/mild on the right.  A small amount of vacuum phenomenon is suspected within the intervertebral disc, eccentric to the left.  Minimal circumferential disc bulging is present, which appears to contact but not significantly displace or compress the traversing L5 nerve roots.  Disc/osteophyte complex is present posterolaterally extending into the left neural foramen.  Degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints, at least moderate on the left and mild on the right.  The findings are resulting in severe compromise of the left neural foramen.  The right neural foramen is patent and no significant compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.     At the L3/L4 level, degenerative endplate changes are present along with moderate-to-advanced narrowing of the intervertebral disc.  Disc/osteophyte complex is present posteriorly which extends laterally protruding into the neural foramen bilaterally.  A superimposed tiny disc protrusion/extrusion is present posteriorly in the midline which may contact the traversing left L4 nerve root.  Moderate degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints which appear to result in a subtle retrolisthesis of the body of L3 with respect to the body of L4 which measures approximately 1-2 mm.  The findings are resulting in moderate-to-severe neural foraminal compromise bilaterally.  No significant compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.     At the L2/3 level, degenerative endplate changes are present, more prominent eccentric to the right.  Narrowing of the intervertebral disc is present, advanced on the right and at least mild on the left.  Disc/ossify complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline which extends laterally protruding into the neural foramen bilaterally, more prominent on the right side.  The posterior disc/osteophyte complex appears to at least contact the traversing L3 nerve root bilaterally, more prominent on the right side.  Degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints, moderate on the right and mild on the left which appears to result in a subtle retrolisthesis of the body of L2 with respect to the body of L3 which measures approximately 2 mm.  The findings are resulting in at least moderate compromise of the right neural foramen and minimal compromise of the left neural foramen.  No significant compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.     At the L1/2 level, degenerative endplate changes are present along with mild narrowing of the intervertebral disc.  A tiny/small disc extrusion along with an annular fissure is present posteriorly straddling the midline which does not appear to involve the traversing L2 nerve roots.  Degenerative change is present involving the facet joints, mild on the right and minimal on the left, which appears to result in a subtle retrolisthesis of the body of L1 with respect to the body of L2 which measures approximately 1-2 mm.  The findings are resulting in the mild compromise of the right neural foramen.  The left neural foramen is patent and no significant compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.     At the T12/L1 level, mild degenerative endplate changes and subtle narrowing of the intervertebral disc are present.  A tiny disc protrusion along with an annular fissure are present posteriorly straddling the midline, but slightly more prominent to the left of midline.  Mild degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints.  No significant neural foraminal compromise or compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.     At the T11/12 level, subtle degenerative endplate changes and mild narrowing of the intervertebral disc are present.  A minuscule disc protrusion is present posteriorly in the midline.  Minor degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints.  No significant neural foraminal compromise or compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.     At the T10/11 level, mild degenerative endplate changes are present along with mild-to-moderate narrowing of the intervertebral disc.  A minuscule disc diffusion is present posteriorly to the left of midline.  Minor degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints.  No significant neural foraminal compromise or compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.  A small incidental perineural cyst is noted within the right neural foramen.     At the T9/10 level, degenerative endplate changes are present along with moderate narrowing of the intervertebral disc.  Minor disc/ossify complex is present posteriorly.  Relatively minor degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints.  No significant neural foraminal compromise or compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.  A tiny incidental perineural cyst is noted within the left neural foramen.     At least mild atheromatous irregularity is present involving the abdominal aorta extending into the iliac arteries bilaterally.  A cystic focus is present arising from the anterosuperior aspect of the right kidney which measures approximately 1 cm in maximal dimension along with a similar-appearing focus arising from the inferior aspect of the left kidney measuring approximately 1.2 cm in maximal dimension.  Diffuse atrophic change is present throughout the visualized posterior paraspinal musculature, gluteal musculature and psoas musculature.  To the extent visualized, the regional soft tissue structures are otherwise unremarkable.     IMPRESSION:     A prominent curvature is present involving the lumbar spine convex to the left.  Multilevel spondylosis resulting in neural foraminal compromise at several levels, as detailed above.  No significant compromise of the thecal sac/spinal canal is appreciated.        ",0

PREVIOUS L4 AND L5 DECOMPRESSION FOR RIGHT-SIDED SYMPTOMS. ?RECURRENT OF SPINAL CANAL STENOSIS     Technique: Sagittal and axial T1 and T2 sequences of the lumbar spine were provided.     Findings:     Compared to plain films dated July 25, 2018     The lowest fully formed vertebral body is labeled L5, and the conus is therefore normally positioned at the L1 level. There is 3 mm of anterior subluxation of L4 upon L5. Alignment is otherwise unremarkable. Vertebral body marrow signal is unremarkable in appearance, other than degenerative endplate changes at the L3-4 and L4-5 levels.     L1-2: Broad-based disc osteophyte complex which does flatten the anterior thecal sac. Neuroforamen are patent bilaterally. Disc spacing preserved.     L2-3: Broad-based disc osteophyte complex resulting in mild canal stenosis with associated ligament flavum hypertrophy. Suspected small midline annular fissure. Associated mild narrowing of both neuroforamen. Disc spacing preserved.     L3-4: Broad-based disc osteophyte complex and ligament flavum hypertrophy contribute to moderate spinal canal stenosis with near complete effacement of CSF around the cauda equina nerve roots. Associated mild right and moderate left-sided foraminal stenosis. Disc spacing preserved. Bilateral facet joint arthropathy. Narrowing of both lateral recesses which may contribute to contact or irritation with the traversing L4 nerve roots bilaterally.

263,"Narrative & Impression  Technique:     T1-weighted, T2-weighted and inversion recovery sagittal and T1 and T2-weighted axial images of the lumbar spine were obtained.  Post intravenous gadolinium enhanced T1-weighted fat-saturated sagittal and T1-weighted without fat saturated axial images were then repeated.     FINDINGS:     History of the L5-S1 discectomy and L3-4 hemilaminectomies in the past.  Previous postoperative MRI of February 24, 2017 is also reviewed.     There appears to be a transitional vertebra and for the description purposes, the last well-formed disc space would be designated as L5-S1, like in the previous report.     The conus medullaris terminates at the T12-L1.  It remains normal.     The T12-L1, L1-L2 and L2-L3 discs demonstrate mild generalized bulge.  It seems that the pedicles at the L2-L3 are congenitally short and this is associated with moderately severe thickening of the ligamenta flava and mild hypertrophic degenerative osteoarthritis of facet joints.  As a combination of these changes, at least a moderate or moderate to marked spinal stenosis has occurred at this level.  Degree of the spinal stenosis has increased in the interval.  The spinal canal is normal at the T12-L1 and L1-L2.     At L3-L4, a marked degenerative disc disease is seen.  Bilateral decompression hemilaminectomies have been performed at this level.  The spinal canal demonstrate a normal caliber.  No residual or recurrent stenosis.  Neural foramina are also normal.  There is no appreciable enhancing scar tissue.     At L4-L5, a marked degenerative disc disease is seen.  This is associated with a mild generalized disc bulge and a small broad-based posterior central disc protrusion.  Degree of the disc protrusion, however, has slightly improved.  The ventral thecal sac is slightly compressed and the lateral recesses are also narrowed.  The bulged/protruded disc abuts against the bilateral descending L5 nerve roots in the lateral recesses.  Bilateral hemilaminectomies are also identified at the L4.  The spinal canal is of the normal caliber.  Neural foramina are also normal.     At L5-S1, a mild generalized at degenerative disc bulge is seen.  This is associated with a small broad-based posterior central disc protrusion with resultant slight compression of ventral thecal sac.  However, there is no neurological compromise.  The neural foramina are normal.  Lateral recesses are also normal on both sides.  There is no spinal canal stenosis.     OPINION:     1.  Normal postoperative changes at the L3-4 and L4-L5, as described above.  There is no residual or recurrent spinal canal stenosis.  Mild generalized at degenerative disc bulge and a small broad-based posterior central disc protrusion at the L4-L5.  The disc abuts against the bilateral descending L5 nerve roots in the lateral recesses.  This was also seen previously and has not significantly changed in the interval.

No vertebral body compression fracture.      Visualized posterior fossa structures are unremarkable.      At C2-3 there are no significant degenerative changes. No neural compromise.      At C3-4 there is a posterior disc osteophyte complex with left paracentral-foraminal prominence. Moderate facet joint arthropathy. In combination there is mild spinal canal stenosis with focal impingement of the spinal cord. Inferior to the level of the disc a linear 0.9 cm focal area of cord signal increase is noted along the anterior cord. Severe left foraminal narrowing. No right foraminal narrowing.      At C4-5 shallow posterior disc osteophyte complex and mild facet joint arthropathy. Minimal indentation of the ventral cord but with no cord signal alteration. Moderate bilateral foraminal narrowing.      At C5-6 there is a posterior disc osteophyte complex with a focal left paracentral prominence. Right facet joint arthropathy.

The cervical spine demonstrates a normal lordotic curvature and alignment.  Vertebral body heights are well-maintained.  Small amount of fatty endplate degenerative change at the C6-C7 level, which has developed from previous.  There is again an incidental tiny hemangioma within the T2 vertebral body.  No concerning bone lesions.      The prevertebral soft tissues are within normal limits.  The paraspinous musculature is grossly unremarkable.  Normal flow-voids within the bilateral vertebral arteries.  No evidence of lymphadenopathy.      The visualized portion of the brain parenchyma is within normal limits.

ALSO NOTES BALANCE AFFECTED     ?SPINAL STENOSIS     COMPARISON: Previous x-ray December 11/12 (Insight Spruce Grove).     TECHNIQUE: Routine non-augmented L-spine radiculopathy protocol.     FINDINGS:  5 lumbar type vertebral bodies are identified, as on prior plain radiograph. There is straightening of the lumbar spine. Minimal anterolisthesis of L3 on L4 by 2 mm (grade 1 severity) is noted, secondary to degenerative facet joint change at this level. Alignment of the lumbar spine is unchanged from previous.     T12-L1 demonstrates broad-based posterior disc bulge with a small posterior annular tear. Moderate degenerative facet joint changes are seen bilaterally. No significant stenosis is seen.     L1-2 demonstrates loss of disc height. Circumferential disc bulge with anterior and posterior osteophyte is noted. Moderate degenerative facet joint changes are seen bilaterally. Mild central spinal stenosis is seen. Moderate bilateral lateral recess stenoses are also identified, possibly affecting the traversing L2 nerve root on either side. Mild right foraminal stenosis is seen.     L2-3 demonstrates loss of disc height. Circumferential disc bulge with advanced degenerative facet joint changes seen. Anterior and posterior osteophyte is noted. Severe central and bilateral lateral recess stenoses result, possibly affecting the traversing L3 nerve root on either side. Mild right foraminal stenosis also seen.     L3-4 demonstrates advanced degenerative facet joint change bilaterally. There is resultant degenerative grade 1 anterolisthesis with posterior unroofing of the disc. Superimposed circumferential disc bulge is seen. This results in severe central and bilateral lateral recess stenoses. This possibly affects the traversing L4 nerve root on either side.

Lumbar spine x-rays performed September 9, 2019 (Allin Clinic) were also reviewed.     Similar curvature of the lumbar spine convex left, centered at L2-3. Vertebral body heights are maintained. Small Schmorl's nodes within the endplates in the thoracolumbar spine. Marrow signal is unremarkable. No focal destructive osseous lesions.     Hypointense T2 disc signal noted within several of the discs, reflecting disc degeneration.     At T11-12, there is moderate loss of disc height. A small disc-osteophyte complex does not affect the conus or nerve roots. No spinal stenosis or neural foraminal stenosis.      At T12-L1, disc height is maintained. A small posterior disc-osteophyte complex does not affect the conus or nerve roots. No spinal stenosis or significant neural foraminal stenosis.     At L1-2, disc height is maintained. A small annular disc bulge does not cause any nerve root impingement. Slight narrowing of both neural foramina. No spinal stenosis. Minor facet degenerative changes.      At L2-3, disc height is maintained. A small annular disc bulge is present, with superimposed small far lateral disc protrusion on the left, encroaching upon the inferior aspect of the left neural foramen, abutting the exiting left L2 nerve root. Mild bilateral facet degenerative changes. No significant lateral recess stenosis or spinal stenosis. Mild stenosis of both neural foramina, more pronounced on the left. Appearances are unchanged.     At L3-4, there is mild loss of disc height eccentrically towards the right. A small posterior disc bulge indents the thecal sac. Mild bilateral facet degenerative changes with mild ligamentum flavum thickening. Slight narrowing of both lateral recesses and mild narrowing of the left neural foramen but no significant spinal stenosis. Appearances are not significantly changed.     At L4-5, there is new mild loss of disc height. New grade I spondylolisthesis of 4 mm noted, secondary to severe left-sided and moderate right-sided facet degeneration. The left-sided facet degeneration appears more severe, with osteophyte protruding anteromedially, encroaching upon the left lateral recess. A new, broad-based left paracentral/posterolateral disc extrusion is present, also encroaching upon the left lateral recess and proximal left neural foramen. As a result, there is now severe stenosis of the left lateral recess with compression of the descending left L5 nerve root. There may be impingement of the exiting left L4 nerve root also. Similar mild narrowing of the right lateral recess. New mild transverse narrowing of the thecal sac. More pronounced narrowing of the left neural foramen, now mild to moderate in severity. No significant stenosis of the right neural foramen.     At L5-S1, there is similar mild loss of disc height. A small shallow disc bulge indents the thecal sac. Bilateral facet degenerative changes of mild to moderate severity. No spinal stenosis, significant lateral recess narrowing nor neural foraminal stenosis. Appearances are not significantly changed.     Prevertebral soft tissues and visualized sacroiliac joints are unremarkable.     OPINION:  1. More pronounced disc degeneration at L4-5. New grade I spondylolisthesis at this level secondary to underlying bilateral (left greater than right) facet degeneration and hypertrophy. New severe stenosis of the left L4-5 lateral recess secondary to a combination of facet degeneration and new left-sided disc extrusion, with resultant compression of the descending left L5 nerve root and possible impingement of the exiting left L4 nerve root.     2. Degenerative disc disease within the remainder of the spine is of similar severity compared to the 2016 MR study.",1

Cervical neural foramina are not well assessed on this study due to technique.     Small (2.1 x 2.7 mm) cystic-appearing focus within the paraspinal musculature to the left of midline the C7-T1 level is nonenhancing and incompletely visualized, presumably just a small incidental cyst. No surrounding enhancement or edema. Visualized posterior fossa structures, cervical spinal cord, and other paraspinal soft tissues are grossly unremarkable.     Thoracic:  No osseous edema or abnormal osseous enhancement in the thoracic spine. No significant spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis is identified in the thoracic region the thoracic spinal cord appears normal in caliber and signal intensity within the limits of this study.      Limited assessment of the thoracic paraspinal soft tissues demonstrates no other significant abnormalities.     Lumbar:  Modic type II degenerative endplate signal change without significant enhancement at the L2-3 level. Mild edema and enhancement of the endplates on either side of the L3-4 disc space. Prominent Schmorl's nodes suspected in the superior endplate of L4. Modic type II degenerative endplate signal change without significant enhancement or edema in the endplates about the L4-5 disc space. Mild edema and enhancement slight endplate irregularity about the L5-S1 disc space. Severe multilevel arthropathy with most prominently on the right at L3-4 through L5-S1 where there is mild osseous edema and enhancement. This most conspicuously involves the right L3-4 facet with some loss of cortex in either side of the joint. There is prominent edema and enhancement within the paraspinal muscles adjacent to these facets. Minimal fluid within the L1-2 through L5-S1 disc spaces.     At T12-L1 and L1-2: Small posterior disc bulges without significant spinal canal stenosis.     At L2-3: Small posterior disc bulge in combination with hypertrophic facet arthropathy mildly narrows the spinal canal. Moderate left and mild right neural foraminal narrowing secondary to facet arthropathy.     At L3-4: Small broad disc bulge and endplate osteophyte and combination with severe right more than left hypertrophic facet arthropathy moderately narrows the central portion the spinal canal. Further enhancing tissue presumably extending from the adjacent facet joint effaces the right neural foramina and subarticular recess, which are both significantly narrow potentially causing impingement upon the right L3 and L4 nerve roots respectively. Moderate to severe left neural foraminal narrowing.     At L4-5: Small broad disc bulge and marked hypertrophic facet arthropathy, narrowing the left more than right subarticular recess but not significantly narrowing the central portion the spinal canal. Severe left and moderate to severe right neural foraminal narrowing secondary to the facet arthropathy. There could also be some distortion of the left L5 nerve root within the subarticular recess.     At L5-S1: Grade 1 anterolisthesis associated bilateral pars interarticularis defects and severe facet arthropathy. There is only mild narrowing of the spinal canal. Severe bilateral neural foraminal narrowing secondary to the facet arthropathy and listhesis.     Limited assessment of the visualized paraspinal soft tissues demonstrates no additional significant abnormalities.     IMPRESSION:  1.  Complex study revealing no convincing single focal source of infection arising from the spine. Advanced degenerative change in the lumbar spine. Mild enhancement within the C3-C6 vertebra, within the endplates on either side of the L1-2, L3-4, and L5-S1 disc spaces, and in the right L3-4 through L5-S1 facets could largely reflect changes of active arthropathy. However, a low-grade or multifocal infection particularly at the lumbar sites of enhancement would be difficult to exclude on MRI. The most prominent finding is cortical irregularity and significant adjacent soft tissue and epidural enhancement surrounding the right L3-4 facet joint, which could reflect infection but is of less certain significance given extent of findings elsewhere.     2.  Multilevel degenerative change in the lumbar spine as detailed. As described there potential nerve root impingement in the spinal canal at L3-4 and in the neural foramina at L3-4 through L5-S1.     3.

There is very minimal curvature of the lower lumbar spine convex to the right.  Lumbar vertebral body heights and alignment are otherwise preserved.  Multilevel endplate degenerative changes are noted primarily at L2-3, L4-5 and L5-L6.  The conus tip is normal at the inferior aspect of L1.      Only minimal degenerative changes are demonstrated at T10-11, T11-12 and T12-L1.  No spinal canal stenosis at any of these levels.      At L1-2, minor broad-based disc bulge is demonstrated without any spinal or foraminal stenosis.      At L2-3, there is minor broad-based disc bulge and minimal facet degenerative change.  No significant spinal or foraminal stenosis.      At L3-4, there is broad-based disc bulge which indents the ventral thecal sac.  Minimal facet degenerative change.  There is minor narrowing of the spinal canal.  No significant foraminal stenosis.      At L4 -5, the disc is narrowed with broad-based disc bulge which is partly calcified.  This only minimally indents the ventral thecal sac.  Minor facet degenerative change.  No significant spinal canal stenosis.  Mild right and more moderate left foraminal stenosis primarily secondary to osteophytes.      At L5-L6, the disc is markedly narrowed and irregular with broad-based posterior osteophytic ridging indenting the ventral thecal sac.  Moderate facet degenerative changes demonstrated.  Together these findings cause moderate acquired spinal canal stenosis.  Moderate bilateral foraminal stenosis secondary primarily to osteophytes.      At L6-S1, minor broad-based disc bulge and posterior osteophytes are demonstrated with developmentally small thecal sac remaining at this level.  Moderate bilateral facet degenerative change.

644,Reason for Exam: LEFT SIDED SCIATICA WITH PAIN DOWN TO TOES. SOME BOWEL   DYSFUNCTION AS WELL.                                                                 QUERY NERVE ROOT IMPINGEMENT.                                                        Technique: Routine lumbar spine protocol is performed.     Findings: Lumbar spine alignment is normal.  Vertebral body heights are   maintained.  The conus medullaris and cauda equina are normal.     At the T12-L1 level the disc is normal.  The thecal sac and exiting nerve roots   are free of compression.                                                             At the L1-2 level there is a small left paracentral disc protrusion which   minimally compresses the anterior aspect of the thecal sac on the left.  The   exiting and transiting nerve roots are free of compression.     At the L2-3 level there is some circumferential disc bulging causing minimal   compression on the anterior aspect of the thecal sac.  The exiting and   transiting nerve roots are free of compression.       At the L3-4 level there is circumferential disc bulging with a small right   paracentral disc protrusion.  There is minimal compression on the anterior   aspect of the thecal sac and some mild lateral recess stenosis is seen.  There   is some mild foraminal encroachment bilaterally but no definite exiting nerve   root or transiting nerve root compressions are seen.     At the L4-5 level there is circumferential disc bulging with a small to   moderate posterior midline disc protrusion with moderate severe facet joint   osteoarthritis bilaterally.  This causes mild central canal stenosis and   moderate severe lateral recess stenosis bilaterally.  The exiting nerve roots   are free of compression.  There is severe transiting nerve root compression   bilaterally.                                                                         At the L5-S1 level there is circumferential disc bulging.  There is a 14 x 9 x   12 mm mass identified in the left lateral recess at the level of the L5   vertebral body likely representing extruded disc material however a   neurofibroma or other neoplastic lesion would be in the differential diagnosis.    This causes moderate compression of the left anterolateral aspect of the   thecal sac.  It appears to be causing severe compression of the exiting left L5   nerve root as it enters the foramina.  Transiting nerve roots remain free of   compression.  The exiting right nerve root is free of compression.  There is   severe facet joint osteoarthritis noted bilaterally.

649,TECHNIQUE: Routine spine protocol.  FINDINGS:  Scan sequences had to be shortened due to patient motion. Slight reduction in image  quality.  5 lumbar type vertebra are assumed to be present. Based on this the conus ends at  the L1 vertebral level and is unremarkable.  Axial and sagittal imaging is performed from T12-L1 through to L5-S1.  T12-L1: Minor disc dehydration. No posterior disc protrusion. Neuroforamina remain  patent.  L1-2: Disc hydration is maintained. Subtle posterior disc bulging. No compromise the  canal. Neuroforamina remain patent.  L2-3: Disc hydration is maintained. No posterior disc protrusion. Neuroforamina  remain patent.  L3-4: Disc hydration is maintained. There is some subtle right parasagittal disc bulging  with some minimal encroachment towards the inferior aspect of the right neural  foramen. The exiting nerve root does not appear impinged. Left neural foramen is  unremarkable. L4-5: Disc hydration is maintained. No posterior disc protrusion. Neuroforamina  remain patent.  L5-S1: Moderate disc dehydration. There is a posterior right parasagittal broad-based  disc protrusion which impinges the descending right S1 nerve root. The left S1 nerve  root is not compromised. Neuroforamina remain patent . Exiting L5 nerve roots do not  appear compromised.  Facet joint appearances are within normal limits.  The vertebral body heights are maintained. There is some minor superior endplate  irregularity at L1 which may be due to remote injury. The vertebral alignment is normal.  SUMMARY:  The predominant finding is a L5-S1 posterior right parasagittal focal disc protrusion  which impinges the descending right S1 nerve root.  Minimal disc bulging at other levels as described  ,0

COMPARISON:    Lumbar spine x-rays January 23, 2020 and lumbar spine MRI December 1, 2017      FINDINGS:   Patient has had right-sided hemilaminectomy of L3-4 and L4-5 with decompression and synovial cyst resection on May 24, 2018.      Five lumbar vertebrae of normal morphology are visualized. The lumbar spine lordosis is maintained. Vertebral body heights are preserved.  No suspicious bone marrow signal abnormality.  The conus medullaris is normal in appearance and terminates at the L1 vertebral body level.        Of note, the incompletely assessed uterus appears bulky and a possible submucosal fibroid is seen, distorting the endometrial lining.      Levels T10-T11 to L1-L2 are unremarkable.  The patient tiny posterior disc bulge is present at L2-L3.  Neural foramina remain patent.  No spinal canal stenosis.      No abnormal enhancement seen on post gadolinium imaging.      L3-4:   8 mm anterolisthesis of L3 on L4 associated with superior uncovering of the disc posteriorly. There is a superimposed small posterior central disc protrusion. Adjacent endplates show diffuse low T1 signal.  Evidence of the right hemilaminectomy.  Advanced left facet hypertrophic osteoarthritis is present and a 7 x 5 x 7 mm (AP x TR x CC) presumed synovial cyst protrudes anteromedially into the spinal canal, further contributing to the overall moderate to severe spinal canal stenosis.  A linear area of increased T2 signal is also seen about the right facet joint medially, possibly representing a recurrent or residual synovial cyst.  The left lateral recess is obliterated, accounting for compression of the left L4 traversing nerve root.  There is moderate left and mild right neural foramina narrowing.      L4-5:    There is a small central disc extrusion indenting the anterior aspect of the thecal sac.  Advanced left facet hypertrophic osteoarthritis is present with asymmetrical thickening of the ligamentum flavum, further contributing to the distortion of the spinal canal.  No spinal canal stenosis. The previously visualized synovial cyst arising from the right facet joint has been surgically removed.  Lateral recesses remain patent.  There is mild left neural foramen narrowing.      L5-S1:   Disc height is severely reduced and pronounced surrounding endplate osteophytes are present.  There is a broad-based posterior disc bulge with a small left central protrusion abutting the traversing left S1 nerve root.  Mild bilateral facet osteoarthritis is noted.

A subtle curvature is present convex to the left which may simply be related to patient positioning. The vertebral body heights are well maintained. The bone marrow signal is fairly homogeneous, allowing for hemangiomata/fatty rests as well as relatively mild degenerative endplate changes at several levels. The conus medullaris terminates normally at approximately the level of the T12/L1 intervertebral disc.     At the S1-S2 level, an underdeveloped disc is noted. No significant neural foraminal compromise or compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.     At the L5-S1 level, subtle degenerative endplate changes are present. Minor degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints. No significant neural foraminal compromise or compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.     At the L4-L5 level, mild degenerative endplate changes are present along with at least mild narrowing of the intervertebral disc. Mild circumferential disc bulging is present and relatively mild disc-osteophyte complex is identified laterally protruding into the region of the neural foramen bilaterally, more prominent on the left side. A superimposed tiny disc protrusion/extrusion is present posteriorly to the left of midline which appears to contact the undersurface of the exiting left L4 nerve root and may contact the traversing left L5 nerve root. Degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints, mild on the left and minimal on the right. The findings are resulting in moderate compromise of the left neural foramen and minimal compromise of the right neural foramen. No significant compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.     At the L3-L4 level, subtle degenerative endplate changes and narrowing of the intervertebral disc are present. Minor disc-osteophyte complex is suspected laterally protruding into the region of the neural foramen bilaterally. Facet joints are unremarkable. No significant neural foraminal compromise or compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.     The remainder of the visualized levels are unremarkable, allowing for minor degenerative disc and facet joint changes.     To the extent visualized, the regional soft tissue structures are unremarkable.     IMPRESSION  Relatively mild multilevel spondylosis, as detailed above. No significant compromise of the thecal sac/spinal canal is appreciated. A tiny disc protrusion/extrusion is identified posteriorly eccentric to left at the L4-L5 level extending into the region of the left neural foramen and along with lateral disc-osteophyte complex that appears to at least contact the exiting left L4 nerve root. Disc protrusion/extrusion may also contact the traversing left L5 nerve root. Clinical correlation is essential.",0

985,"MRI OF THE LUMBAR SPINE     HISTORY: Falling from leg weakness. ? Nerve impingement.     TECHNIQUE: Transverse and sagittal images were obtained through the lumbar spine and sacrum.     FINDINGS: There appear to be six lumbar-type vertebrae noted with the transitional L6 vertebra.     Vertebral body heights in the lumbar spine are maintained and bone marrow signals are normal.     The mid to upper sacral region is extremely deformed, likely secondary to radiation osteitis.     At the L3-L4 level, the disc is normal. The thecal sac, exiting, and transiting nerve roots are free of compression.     At the L4-L5 level, the disc is normal. The thecal sac, exiting, and transiting nerve roots are free of compression.     At the L5-L6 level, the disc is normal. The thecal sac, exiting, and transiting nerve roots are free of compression. There is severe facet joint osteoarthritis.     At the transition between the L6 vertebra and the sacrum, there is an old deformed disc. There is some mild foraminal encroachment bilaterally with some mild exiting nerve root compression seen.     The body of the sacrum is markedly deformed and shows some expansion and inhomogeneity of the bone. This appears to be causing significant encroachment of the sacral foramina with probable bilateral exiting nerve root compressions at several levels in the mid to upper sacrum. Multiple perineural root sleeve cysts are identified within the spinal canal, the largest on the right measuring 2.4 cm.     No definite pre-sacral soft tissue masses or fluid collections seen.     IMPRESSION:   The lumbar spine is relatively normal with no significant exiting or transiting nerve root compression seen. Again there is significant expansion of the bone of the sacrum likely due to prior radiation osteitis resulting in bilateral mid and upper sacral foraminal encroachments causing exiting nerve root compressions at several levels.

Â   COMPARISON: Radiographs of May 15, 2020 and MRI of July 20, 2017  Â   FINDINGS:  Spinal curvature, vertebral body height, and background marrow signal are normal.  The visualized spinal cord is of normal caliber and signal and the conus medullaris is in normal position.    Â   L5 spondylolysis with grade 1 anterior spondylolisthesis of approximately 16% appears similar to previous. There is mild marrow edema along the margins of the spondylolysis of the pars interarticularis on the right side, similar to previous as well. The same level disc is partially desiccated. There is mild focal protrusion at the left foramen causing mild impingement of the exiting L5 nerve root between the disc and L5 pedicle. This appears new. However, there does remain some perineural fat in the foramen anteriorly and posteriorly. It is moderately narrowed overall. The right foramen is only mildly narrowed with no exiting nerve root impingement. The spinal canal is widely patent. Mild facet degeneration is noted on the left.  Â   Above L5, there is no significant spondylosis. The spinal canal and intervertebral foramina are widely patent.  Â   IMPRESSION: Mild L5-S1 spondylosis with L5 spondylolysis resulting in stable grade 1 anterior spondylolisthesis compared to previous MR from just over 3 years ago. Mild left foraminal focal disc protrusion however appears new and mildly impinges the exiting L5 nerve root between the small disc protrusion and the L5 pedicle. Otherwise no adverse change.",0
