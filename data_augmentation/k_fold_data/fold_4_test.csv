Vertebral body heights are maintained. There are 5 lumbar-type vertebra. Multilevel   vertebral body hemangiomas are noted. No suspicious bone marrow signal abnormality.       There is constitutionally narrowing of the spinal canal, particularly at the lower lumbar levels distal to L2.       At L2/3, there is shallow circumferential noncompressive disc bulge which just touches the descending left L3 nerve root in the   lateral recess without definite compression. There is bilateral neural foraminal stenosis at this level secondary to loss of   intervertebral disc height, shallow disc bulge and endplate osteophytosis.       At L3/4, there is mild to moderate central canal stenosis secondary to combination of constitutionally narrowed canal, shallow   posterior disc bulge, moderate facet joint degeneration and flaval buckling. There is bilateral lateral recess stenosis with   possible compression of the descending L4 nerve roots bilaterally. No significant neural foraminal stenosis.       At L4/5, there is moderate to severe central canal stenosis secondary to combination of constitutionally narrowed canal, shallow   posterior disc bulge, severe bulky facet joint degeneration and flaval buckling with crowding of the cauda equina stenosis of both  lateral recesses with probable compression of the descending L5 nerve roots bilaterally. There is left-sided neural foraminal   stenosis.       L5/S1, there is shallow noncompressive posterior disc bulge. No significant central canal stenosis. No significant neural   foraminal stenosis. There is mild bilateral facet joint degeneration.       Shallow noncompressive disc bulges are seen elsewhere throughout the proximal lumbar and distal thoracic spine up to the level of  T11 with no significant central canal or neural foraminal stenosis at these levels.

RECENT MOVEMENT RESTRICTION MAINLY BENDING AND STANDING.           HISTORY:  As above.     TECHNIQUE:  Standard radiculopathy protocol, consisting of sagittal T1 and T2 imaging from T12 to the upper sacrum and axial T1 and T2 imaging from L3-4 to L5-S1. Sagittal and coronal STIR imaging of the lower lumbar spine and complete sacrum was also acquired.     FINDINGS:  Comparison made to the CTA abdomen/pelvis from May 31, 2017 and CT colonography study from March 30, 2015 (both performed at Sturgeon Hospital). Lumbar spine x-rays from September 9, 2019 (Insight Medical Imaging) were also reviewed.     Five lumbar vertebrae are assumed. Straightening of the lumbar lordosis. Similar mild curvature convex left centered at L4. Vertebral body heights are maintained. Mild degenerative endplate changes at L2-3. Small fatty rests or intraosseous hemangiomas within multiple vertebrae, of doubtful significance.     Conus medullaris to the extent visualized is unremarkable, terminating at the L1 level. No fatty filum terminale.     There is a large, CSF signal intensity, lobulated and septated cystic structure within the sacral spinal canal, extending into the lower lumbar spinal canal up to the inferior L4 level. The lesion has multiple loculations, most, if not all, of which appear to communicate with each other. There is marked expansion of the sacral spinal canal, with prominent scalloping of the posterior margins of the S1, S2 and S3 vertebral bodies. There is marked thinning of the S2 and S3 vertebral bodies in particular. Locules extend into the S2-3 and S3-4 neural foramina, with a small component extending into the right S1-2 neural foramen also. The lumbar canal component of the lesion is situated posterolaterally towards the left, causing expansion of the lumbar spinal canal and remodeling of the posterior elements. The lumbar thecal sac is displaced anterolaterally towards the right. Posterior scalloping of the L2-L5 vertebral bodies noted. All of these findings are not significantly changed from the   prior CT studies, allowing for differences in modality.     Dimensions of this cystic lesion are 2.9 cm AP x 5.8 cm TR x 13.1 cm CC.     At T12-L1, the disc is normal. No spinal stenosis or neural foraminal stenosis.     At L1-2, disc height and signal are reasonably maintained. A small posterior disc bulge indents the ventral thecal sac and slightly encroaches upon the inferior aspect of both neural foramina. No nerve root impingement, spinal stenosis or neural foraminal stenosis.     At L2-3, there is moderate loss of disc height with diffuse hypointense T2 disc signal indicative of disc degeneration. A small broad-based posterior disc bulge indents the ventral thecal sac. No significant neural foraminal narrowing, spinal stenosis or lateral recess stenosis. Minor facet degenerative changes.     At L3-4, disc height is preserved. Subtle T2 hypointense signal reflecting early disc degeneration. A small, shallow posterior disc-osteophyte complex indents the ventral thecal sac but does not cause any nerve root impingement. No spinal stenosis, neural foraminal stenosis or lateral recess narrowing. Minor facet degenerative changes on the right.     At L4-5, disc height is preserved. Diffuse hypointense T2 disc signal indicative of disc degeneration. A small to moderate-sized broad-based posterior disc-osteophyte complex compresses the ventral thecal sac. This abuts but does not displace the descending S1 nerve roots. No significant lateral recess stenosis or superimposed spinal stenosis on a degenerative basis. Slight narrowing of both neural foramina but no impingement of either exiting L4 nerve root. Aforementioned cyst extends into the left lateral recess and compresses the descending left L5 nerve root, displacing it anteromedially.     At L5-S1, disc height is preserved. Diffuse hypointense T2 disc signal. A small broad-based posterior disc-osteophyte complex indents the ventral thecal sac. It slightly encroaches upon the inferior aspect of both neural foramina, resulting in mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing. Mild facet degenerative changes. No evidence of spondylolysis or significant spondylolisthesis. There is thickening or tethering of the ventral thecal sac at the mid S1 level, which may involve the descending left S2 nerve root. Both descending S1 nerve roots are displaced anteriorly by the cystic lesion.     Prevertebral soft tissues and visualized sacroiliac joints are unremarkable.     OPINION:  1. Multilobulated and septated CSF signal intensity cystic lesion consistent with a large expansile Tarlov cyst situated within the sacral spinal canal, extending into the lower lumbar spinal canal. Adjacent bony remodeling implies this is a long-standing lesion. It causes mild compression and displacement of the thecal sac, compressing and displacing the descending L5 and bilateral S1 nerve roots anteriorly. Size and extent of the cyst are not grossly changed going back to the 2015 CT study.     2. Degenerative disc disease from L2-3 to L5-S1.

200,"History: Radiculopathy in L5-S1 with persistent numbness (loss of light touch, sharp and dull sensation) to right forefoot. Now moving into left forefoot, reflexes absent. Normal motor and SLR negative. Had hack pain 6 months ago, has noe now. Increasing peripheral neuropathy NYD. History of HTN, obesity only.     TECHNIQUE: Routine lumbar spine protocol.     FINDINGS:  5 lumbar type vertebral are assumed to be present.  Based on this the conus ends at the L1 vertebral level and is unremarkable.     L1-2: Along the left parasagittal margin of the disc is a tiny focal disc protrusion encroaching into the inferior aspect of the neural foramen.  The exiting nerve root is not compromised.  The right neural foramen is unremarkable.  Intervertebral disc space and height is maintained.  Disc hydration is within normal limits.     L2-3: Disc height and hydration is maintained.  No posterior disc protrusion.  Neuroforamina remain patent.     L3-4: Intervertebral disc is dehydrated.  There is mild to moderate loss of the disc height.  Posterior midline and left parasagittal broad-based moderate-sized disc protrusion which encroaches into the left lateral recess space.  The disc protrusion impinges the descending left L4 nerve root.  No significant encroachment into the neural foramen.  The descending right L4 nerve root is not compromised.  Right neural foramen is patent.     L4-5: Intervertebral disc is dehydrated.  There is moderate loss of the disc height.  Posterior broad-based disc bulging extending across the posterior margin of the disc.  Along the midline and right parasagittal aspect the disc is more prominent with moderate sized protrusion.  The disc impinges upon the thecal sac.  The disc encroaches into the right lateral recess space with mild impingement of the descending right L5 nerve root.  The disc protrusion also encroaches into the entrance to the right neural foramen.  The exiting L4 nerve root is not impinged.  The disc bulging also has minor encroachment into inferior aspect of the left neural foramen with no significant compromise of the exiting L4 nerve root.     L5-S1: Intervertebral disc is dehydrated.  A focal small right parasagittal disc protrusion which impinges the descending right S1 nerve root.  The descending left S1 nerve root is not compromised.  Neuroforamina remain patent.     Vertebral alignment is normal.  Vertebral body heights are maintained.     Lumbar facet joints are unremarkable.     SUMMARY:     There is potential for nerve root irritation at the L3-4, L4-5 and L5-S1 levels as described.  Correlation with the distribution of symptoms is suggested to assess the most clinically significant nerve root impingements.  On MR imaging these are at L3-4 the descending left L4 nerve root, at L4-5 the descending right L5 nerve root, and L5-S1 the descending right S1 nerve root.",0

225,"HISTORY:Ongoing low back pain, radiculopathy down right leg  COMPARISON:None  TECHNIQUE: Sagittal T1, T2, axial T2  FINDINGS:  For the purposes of this report the lowest free vertebral body is labeled L5. There is  straightening of the normal lumbar lordosis. The conus is normally located and  demonstrates normal morphology.  There are both focal and heterogenous areas of T1 and T2 hypointensity distributed  throughout the visualized bone marrow largest areas are seen in the right sacroiliac  and left ilium on the axial images and measuring up to 3.7 cm. These areas are  avidly T1 hypointense, more hypointense than the vertebral disc. There is no  associated fracture identified.  The appearances raise possibility of an underlying marrow infiltrative process.  Limited assessment of the retroperitoneal structures demonstrates no significant  abnormality.  L1-2: Mild generalized disc bulge causes no significant central canal or  neuroforaminal stenosis.  L2-3: Mild generalized disc bulge minimally narrows subarticular recesses. There is  mild bilateral neuroforaminal stenosis.  L3-4: Moderate generalized disc bulge with a focal right paracentral neuroforaminal  component. The combination causes severe right-sided neuroforaminal stenosis.  There is mild narrowing of the lateral recess. Moderate left neuroforaminal stenosis  and moderate facet arthropathy is present. L4-5: There is a right paracentral and neural foraminal disc protrusion. This causes  severe right neuroforaminal stenosis. There is mild left neuroforaminal stenosis and  narrowing of the right subarticular and lateral recess with the disc protrusion  contacting and displacing the traversing right L5 nerve root. There is moderate facet  arthropathy.  L5-S1: Broad-based posterior disc protrusion narrows the subarticular recesses  bilaterally. Combination with severe facet arthropathy, there is severe bilateral  neuroforaminal stenosis.

294,"MRI LUMBAR SPINE  Technique:  Multiplanar multisequence MRI of the lumbosacral spine was performed.  FINDINGS:  The conus medullaris terminates at the L1-2. It is normal. The L1-2 disc space is  normal. The thecal sac, spinal canal and neural foramina are also normal at this level.  A mild degenerative disc bulge is seen at the L2-3 but the thecal sac, spinal canal and  neural foramina are normal.  At L3-4, a moderate degree generalized at degenerative disc bulge is seen. This is  associated with a mild to moderate degree reduction in the height of the disc space and  anterior marginal osteophyte formation. The thecal sac, spinal canal and neural  foramina are normal.  The L4-5 disc is normal. The thecal sac, spinal canal and neural foramina are normal.  There is a mild hypertrophic degenerative osteoarthritic is of bilateral facet joints at this  level.  At L5-S1, at least a moderate degree degenerative disc bulge is seen. Height of the  disc is space is slightly reduced and there is a posterior marginal osteophyte formation  on the left side which is causing narrowing of the inferior portion of the left L5-S1 neural  foramen. I suspect a mild compression of the left L5 nerve root outside the foramen  because of the marginal osteophyte. The right neural foramen and exiting right L5  nerve root are normal. Descending bilateral S1 nerve roots are normal in the lateral  recesses. Facet joints are normal.  OPINION: A moderate degree degenerative disc disease at L3-4 and L5-S1. The disc-osteophyte  formation is more pronounced in the left lateral aspect at the L5-S1 where the left L5  nerve root may be slightly impinged just outside the foramen, if any. Degenerative  osteoarthritis of the L4-5 facet joints is seen.  The Workers' Compensation Board has requested that we provide a professional  opinion as to whether the imaging findings are related whole or in part to the injury in  question. This is not considered part of the official diagnostic imaging report, and will  only be used to help a WCB caseworker decide whether the injury is work-related or  not.

Small anterior osteophytes are present extending from the C3/4 level superiorly down through the C6/7 level inferiorly. The cerebellar tonsils appear normal with respect to position.      At the C2/3 level, the intervertebral disc is unremarkable. The neural foramina appear patent.      At the C3/4 level, fairly prominent degenerative endplate changes are present. Degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints which results in an anterolisthesis of the body of C3 with respect to the body of C4 which measures approximately 5 to 6 mm with associated uncovering of the posterior aspect of the intervertebral disc. Disc/osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline which along with hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum results in mild compression of the adjacent thecal sac/spinal cord. Subtle focal abnormal increased T2 signal is present within the adjacent spinal cord compatible with edematous change. Degenerative change is present involving the uncovertebral joint bilaterally. The findings are resulting in fairly advanced neural foraminal compromise bilaterally.      At the C4/5 level, degenerative endplate changes are present along with moderate narrowing of the intervertebral disc. Degenerative change is present involving the facet joints which results in an anterolisthesis of the body of C4 with respect to the body of C5 measuring approximately 3 mm with associated uncovering of the posterior aspect of the intervertebral disc. A tiny disc protrusion is present posteriorly, straddling the midline but slightly more prominent to the left of midline, which appears to abut but not significantly compress the ventral surface of the adjacent spinal cord. Degenerative changes are present involving the uncovertebral joint bilaterally. The findings are resulting in moderate compromise of the left neural foramen and mild compromise of the right neural foramen.      At the C5/6 level, degenerative endplate changes are present along with moderate to advanced narrowing of the intervertebral disc. A small amount of vacuum phenomenon is suspected within the intervertebral disc. Degenerative change is present involving the facet joints which appears to result in a subtle retrolisthesis of the body of C5 with respect to the body of C6 which measures approximately 2 mm.

There is a broad-based left posterolateral/foraminal disc protrusion narrowing the left lateral recess and the left neural foramen. Mild indentation upon the descending left L2 nerve root noted. No impingement of the exiting left L1 nerve root. No stenosis of the right lateral recess. Minor narrowing of the right neural foramen. No spinal stenosis. Minor facet degenerative changes.     At L2-3, there is mild loss of disc height. A small shallow posterior disc bulge does not affect the descending nerve roots. Mild facet degenerative changes. No spinal stenosis or lateral recess stenosis. Mild narrowing of both neural foramina.     At L3-4, disc height is preserved. A small broad-based disc bulge indents the thecal sac. Mild bilateral facet degenerative change and moderate ligamentum flavum thickening. Combination of these findings results in mild stenoses of both lateral recesses and both neural foramina. No significant spinal stenosis.     At L4-5, there is grade I spondylolisthesis of 5 mm secondary to severe bilateral facet degeneration and moderate ligamentum flavum thickening. Mild loss of disc height with a small shallow posterior disc bulge. Combination of these findings results in mild stenoses of both lateral recesses and mild spinal stenosis. There is a 7 mm T2 hyperintense cyst with thin hypointense rim situated laterally within the right lateral recess, anterior to the right facet joint. This is suspicious for a perineural or synovial cyst. It compresses the exiting right L4 nerve root proximally within the neural foramen. Mild to moderate stenosis of the left neural foramen.     At L5-S1, there is mild loss of disc height. Grade I spondylolisthesis of 5 mm, likely secondary to underlying facet degenerative change (worse on the right). A small posterior disc bulge abuts the descending S1 nerve roots. Neither root is displaced. Mild stenoses of both lateral recesses, slightly more so on the right. No significant spinal stenosis. There is severe stenosis of the right neural foramen, with effacement of the perineural fat and compression of the exiting right L5 nerve root. Moderate stenosis of the left neural foramen also noted, with slight flattening of the exiting left L5 nerve root.     Incidental 8 mm Tarlov cyst within the sacral spinal canal at the S2 level, of doubtful significance. Mild degenerative changes within the visualized sacroiliac joints. Mild symmetric posterior paraspinal muscle atrophy.     OPINION:  1. Grade I spondylolisthesis of L4 and L5 and L5 on S1 secondary to advanced facet degeneration at both levels. Severe stenosis of the right L5-S1 neural foramen with compression of the exiting right L5 nerve root.     2. Mild spinal stenosis and mild bilateral lateral recess stenoses at L4-5. A 7 mm synovial cyst or perineural cyst within the right L4-5 lateral recess encroaches upon the proximal right neural foramen, compressing the exiting right L4 nerve root.     3. Mild bilateral lateral recess narrowing and neural foraminal narrowing at L3-4.     4. Nonspecific T1/T2 hypointense lesion within the L1 vertebral body. A metastatic deposit is a possibility, given the history of breast cancer. A lipid poor intraosseous hemangioma is in the differential. A repeat bone scan/SPECT-CT is suggested for further assessment.",0

610,"TECHNIQUE: MRI of the lumbar spine was performed utilizing sagittal T1, T2, and STIR sequences through the entire lumbar spine, with axial T1 and T2 sequences through the lower 3 disc levels.     FINDINGS: Comparison is made to lumbar spine x-rays from October 07, 2019 and June 04, 2011.  These x-rays demonstrate 5 lumbar type vertebral bodies, as well as a cyst with a sclerotic margin along the posterior portion of the L4 vertebral body.     The MRI also demonstrates a cyst within the posterior aspect of the L4 vertebral body, along its left aspect.  This cyst measures 1.5 cm craniocaudad by 1 cm AP by 0.9 cm transverse, and appears stable when compared to the prior x-rays.  The MRI also demonstrates a low T1 and T2 signal intensity rim, consistent with the sclerosis on the x-rays.  This is associated with endplate irregularity along the superior aspect of the L4 vertebral body, which suggests that this is degenerative in etiology.  There is a small amount of fibrovascular endplate degenerative changes along the posterior left aspect of the L5-S1 level, preferentially involving the L5 endplate.  There is also evidence of extensive fatty endplate degenerative changes along the anterior aspect of the L4-L5 level.  Anterior osteophytes at multiple levels, preferentially at the L4-L5 level.     The visualized portion of the retroperitoneum is within normal limits.  The paraspinous musculature is unremarkable.  The conus medullaris is normal in appearance, and terminates normally at approximately the L1-L2 disc level.     The visualized portion of the lower thoracic spine and the upper lumbar spine demonstrate relatively normal discs, with no significant spinal canal/neural foraminal narrowing.     L3-L4: There is mild degenerative disc disease, with loss of normal disc signal, endplate irregularity, tiny anterior osteophytes, and subtle loss of disc height.  The cyst within the L4 vertebral body has been described previously.  There is also a tiny right foraminal disc protrusion that results in mild right inferior neural foraminal narrowing, but no evidence of compression of the exiting right L3 nerve root.  No significant spinal canal narrowing at this level.  No significant facet arthropathy.     L4-L5: There is moderate degenerative disc disease, with moderate loss of disc height, loss of disc signal, fatty endplate degenerative change, anterior osteophytes, and a mild diffuse disc bulge.  No significant facet arthropathy.  These findings result in minimal spinal canal narrowing, but no evidence of compression or displacement of the L5 nerve roots within the lateral recesses.  There is also evidence of mild bilateral inferior neural foraminal narrowing, but no evidence of compression of the exiting nerve roots.     L5-S1: There is mild to moderate degenerative disc disease, with preferential disc height loss along the left aspect of the disc level, where there is also a small amount of fibrovascular endplate degenerative change.  There is also loss of disc signal.  There is a mild disc bulge with a superimposed left paracentral disc protrusion.  No significant facet arthropathy or ligamentum flavum hypertrophy.  These findings result in left lateral recess narrowing with posterior displacement and mild flattening of the left S1 nerve root, concerning for compression.  Mild bilateral inferior neural foraminal narrowing, but no evidence of definitive compression of the exiting nerve roots.     IMPRESSION:     The L5-S1 level demonstrates mild to moderate degenerative disc disease, preferentially along the left aspect, where there is also left-sided fibrovascular endplate degenerative changes.  There is also a left paracentral disc protrusion at this level which results in posterior displacement and what appears to be mild compression of the left S1 nerve root within the lateral recess.  This could be a cause of the patient's left-sided symptoms.     2.          Moderate degenerative disc disease at the L4-L5 level, with associated fatty endplate degenerative changes and a mild diffuse disc bulge, but no significant spinal canal/neural foraminal narrowing.     3.          Mild degenerative disc disease at the L3-L4 level.  There are findings most suggestive of a degenerative endplate cyst arising off of the superior endplate of L4 and extending into the left/posterior aspect of the L4 vertebral body.  This is an unusual degenerative endplate finding, but the fact that the cyst was seen on the 2011 x-rays, and is grossly stable when compared to the prior x-rays, suggests that this is a benign finding.     The Workers' Compensation Board has requested that we provide a professional opinion as to whether the imaging findings are related whole or in part to the injury in question. This is not considered part of the official diagnostic imaging report, and will only be used to help a WCB caseworker decide whether the injury is work-related or not. My opinion is:  WCB Category - Some of the imaging findings could be related to the patient's injury.",0

654,"History:  Lower back pain, radicular symptoms. Has lower legs pain, numbness some  weakness.  Technique:  Standard protocol for lumbar spine.  Findings:  Assuming 5 lumbar vertebrae, normal conus medullaris terminates in L1.  Bone marrow signal and vertebral body height are normal.  Her congenitally short pedicles do predispose to central stenosis.  Variable (mild to moderate) disc degeneration is present in all levels between L2 and  S1.  No significant abnormality is seen above L2. There is no neural compromise.  In L2-3, a broad posterior disc bulge slightly indents the ventral thecal sac but does not  cause neural compromise. Facet joints are normal.  In L3-4, severe bilateral facet OA has resulted in mild (grade 1 or less) anterolisthesis.  The anterolisthesis, her congenitally smaller canal, hypertrophic change from facet joint  and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy all result in moderate/severe central stenosis  whereby the central canal is reduced to a sagittal dimension of barely 5 mm, appearing  to completely efface subarachnoid space at the disc level.  MRI LUMBAR SPINE  There is concurrent severe bilateral lateral recess, which could also compromise  bilateral descending L4 nerves where they exit the thecal sac. Bilateral neuroforamina  remain patent.  In L4-5, severe bilateral facet OA is associated with mild grade 1 degenerative  anterolisthesis. Similar to L3-4 above, constellation of findings result in mild central  stenosis. However, central canal is probably still adequate in this level, with some  preserved subarachnoid space. Neural foramina are patent.  In L5 1, there is severe bilateral facet OA without spondylolisthesis. The disc is actually  normal, and no neural compromise is seen in this level.  Impression:  A constellation of degenerative changes result in severe central stenosis in L3-4 along  with severe stenosis of the bilateral lateral recess. Clinical correlation is required  regarding cauda equina syndrome or L4 radiculopathy.  Mild central stenosis in L4-5 is due to the same Constellation of pathologies. However,  no convincing neural compromise is seen in this level.  There is severe bilateral facet OA in all levels from L3-4 to L5-S1.",0

701,"Narrative & Impression  MR LUMBAR SPINE        Reason for Exam: 18-YEAR-OLD MALE, SEVERE, PROGRESSIVE LOW BACK PAIN RADIATES TO THE LEGS ON WALKING AND LAYING DOWN AND REALLY AFFECTING HIS WORK. X-RAYS DONE 2017 SHOWED MILD-TO-MODERATE DISC HEIGHT NARROWING AT L5-S1. HE ALSO HAS HISTORY OF THORACIC SCOLIOSIS. POSITIVE SLR. URGENT     COMPARISON: Previous x-ray May 2/17 (Hardisty Heatlh Centre).     TECHNIQUE: Routine non-augmented L-spine radiculopathy protocol.     FINDINGS:  5 lumbar type vertebral bodies are identified, as on prior plain radiograph. Conus medullaris is therefore noted to terminate normally at L1. There is limited visualization of the thoracolumbar junction. However, very minimal anterior wedging is seen. Schmorl's nodes are noted involving the superior and inferior endplates of T12, as well as the superior endplate of L1. This may relate to congenital Scheuermann's disease.     T11-12 demonstrates loss of disc height. Minimal posterior disc osteophyte complex is seen, along with mild degenerative facet joint change bilaterally. No stiffness stenosis results at this level.     T12-L1 demonstrates mild degenerative facet joint change bilaterally. No significant stenosis seen.     L1-2 and L2-3 are unremarkable, as assessed on sagittal sequences. No significant stenosis seen.     L3-4 demonstrates minimal degenerative facet joint change on the left. No stenosis seen at this level.     L4-5 demonstrates a small left paracentral disc protrusion and associated annular tear. T2 bright material is seen extending from the left paracentral annular tear inferior to the disc level. This extends into the right lateral recess measuring approximately 4 x 8 x 9 mm (AP x T x CC) in size. This is favored to represent sequelae of a sequestered disc fragment, and is compressing the traversing right L5 nerve root within the lateral recess. Mild degenerative facet joint changes are seen bilaterally. There is minimal stenosis of the left lateral recess also noted at this level. No other significant stenosis seen.     L5-S1 demonstrates a small central disc protrusion. In addition, there is a small 7 mm disc fragment seen to the right of midline just above this level. This is probably another small sequestered disc fragment. This may be coming from the L5-S1 disc, or possibly from the L4-5 disc above. In any event, this disc fragment is compressing the right L5 nerve root just prior to entering the right neural foramen. Mild degenerative facet joint changes are seen bilaterally. No other significant stenosis seen at this level.     IMPRESSION: Sequestered disc fragment within the right lateral recess at L4-5, probably arising from the L4-5 disc level. This is compressing the traversing right L5 nerve root. Additional sequestered disc fragment just inferior to this, also compressing the right L5 nerve root just before it enters the neural foramen at L5-S1.",0

From previous plain radiograph, this is noted to be and L1 vertebral body with rudimentary ribs. 5 lumbar type vertebral bodies are identified. Conus medullaris is therefore noted to terminate normally at L1-2. Alignment of the lumbar spine is satisfactory.     L3-4 demonstrates mild degenerative facet joint change bilaterally but is otherwise unremarkable. No stenosis seen.     L4-5 demonstrates a large right paracentral disc extrusion. This has worsened from previous. Extruded disc material extends into the right lateral recess and may be affecting the traversing right L5 nerve root. There is also a sequestered disc fragment within the left lateral recess, possibly affecting the traversing left L5 nerve root as well. Moderate central spinal stenosis is also seen. Mild degenerative facet joint changes are seen bilaterally, but no significant foraminal stenosis is seen on either side.     L5-S1 demonstrates broad-based posterior disc bulge and osteophyte. Previous left laminectomy noted. Mild degenerative facet joint changes are seen bilaterally. No residual central or lateral recess stenosis is seen. Mild right and moderate left foraminal stenoses are identified, similar to previous.     IMPRESSION: Worsening right paracentral disc extrusion at L4-5. Sequestered disc fragment is also seen within the left lateral recess at this level. This could be affecting the traversing L5 nerve root on either side.",0

723,"Reason for Exam: INCREASING PAIN, MOBILITY DECREASED SINCE LAST EXAM     Technique: Routine lumbar spine protocol is performed.     Findings: There is a moderate dextroconvex mid lumbar spine scoliosis.  There is a grade 1 anterolisthesis of L2 on L3.  The findings are unchanged from the recent study done January 7, 2020.     At the T12-L1 level there is circumferential disc bulging with a small to moderate right paracentral disc protrusion unchanged.  This causes some compression on the anterior aspect of the thecal sac.  Some transiting nerve root compression is noted on the right.     At the L1-2 level there is circumferential disc bulging unchanged.  There is some mild lateral recess stenosis on the left.  Again possible exiting nerve root compression on the left.     At the L2-3 level there is circumferential disc bulging and severe facet joint osteoarthritis which remain stable.  Mild central canal stenosis and severe lateral recess stenosis and transiting nerve root compressions again noted.  Mild exiting nerve root compression suspected on the left.     At the L3-4 level circumferential disc bulging is again noted.  Mild central canal stenosis.

725,"Reason for Exam: RADICULOPATHY, MAINLY C6 AND C7 RT THAN LT, ADVANCED ARTHRITIS, SHOOTING PAIN FROM THE NECK TO ARMS AND LEGS     DISC PROBLEM, SPINAL CORD PRESSURE, H/O TBI     Technique: Sagittal T1 and T2 and axial T2-3-D medic sequences of the cervical spine were performed.     Findings:     Compared to plain films dated October 28, 2020.     The visualized posterior fossa demonstrates an unremarkable appearance, with normally positioned cerebellar tonsils.  The visualized spinal cord demonstrates a normal appearance with no altered signal or evidence of syrinx. There is 3 mm of anterior subluxation of C3 upon C4. Alignment of the cervical spine is otherwise unremarkable.  Vertebral body marrow signal is diffusely heterogeneous, with advanced degenerative endplate changes at the C3-4 level as well as the C6-7 level.     C2-3: Mild disc osteophyte complex causing flattening of anterior thecal sac. Neuroforamen remain patent bilaterally.     C3-4: Broad-based disc osteophyte complex resulting in moderate spinal canal stenosis with some associated mass effect upon the spinal cord. There is also some subtle increased T2 signal intensity noted within the right posterior aspect of the spinal cord concerning for edema/myelomalacia. Bilateral uncovertebral joint osteophytes result in mild bilateral foraminal stenosis, right greater than left. Severe disc space narrowing. Bilateral facet joint arthropathy.     C4-5: Broad-based disc osteophyte complex resulting in mild spinal canal stenosis. Bilateral uncovertebral joint osteophytes result in suspected mild bilateral foraminal stenosis. The left-sided neural foramen is suboptimally assessed due to metallic artifact due to a foreign body within the left-sided paraspinal soft tissues. This was appreciated on the plain films of October 28, 2020. Mild disc space narrowing.     C5-6: Broad-based disc osteophyte complex resulting in moderate spinal canal stenosis. Bilateral uncovertebral joint osteophytes result in moderate right-sided and mild left-sided foraminal stenosis. Moderate disc space narrowing.      C6-7: Broad-based disc osteophyte complex resulting in mild spinal canal stenosis. Bilateral uncovertebral joint osteophytes result in mild bilateral foraminal stenosis. Mild disc space narrowing.     The imaged upper thoracic spine demonstrates additional broad-based disc osteophyte complexes at every level resulting in some mild spinal canal stenosis. Associated foraminal stenosis is noted particularly on the right hand side of a moderate degree at the T1-2 level.     Impression:     Multilevel degenerative changes as described, with moderate right-sided foraminal stenosis noted at the C5-6 level, which may result in irritation of the exiting right C6 nerve root. Additionally, there is subtle increased T2 signal intensity within the right aspect of the spinal cord centered at the C3-4 level suggestive of edema/myelomalacia. There is moderate canal stenosis at this level which does result in some mild mass effect upon the spinal cord although no significant spinal cord compression was noted at this time.",1
744,"Compared with October 22, 2012     TECHNIQUE:     Sagittal and axial T1 and T2 weighted images of the lumbar spine.     FINDINGS:     There is a couple of millimeters anterolisthesis of L4 on L5. This has increased slightly compared with 2012.  Lumbar vertebral body heights, alignment and marrow signal are otherwise within normal limits.  The visualized lower thoracic cord and conus are normal with the conus tip at the inferior aspect of L1.     At L1-2, minor facet degenerative changes demonstrated with no disc herniation, spinal or foraminal stenosis.     At L2-3, minor broad-based disc bulge is noted.  Minor facet and ligamentous degenerative change.  These findings result in mild narrowing of the spinal canal.  No foraminal stenosis.     At L3-4, there is broad-based disc bulge which indents the ventral thecal sac.  Mild facet and ligamentous degenerative changes demonstrated.

754,"Narrative & Impression  History of low back pain with lower limb radiation.     Sagittal STIR, T1, T2 sequences of the lumbar spine including T11; with axial T1/2 images L3-S1 and axial T2 images T12-L3.  Reviewed in conjunction with the previous comparable study of May 1, 2018.  Increased BMI.     T11-12 and T12-L1 discs are normal.  Conus terminates at upper L1.     Lumbar intervertebral discs show degrees of degenerative signal loss with osteophytic lipping.  L4-5 and L5-S1 discs show marked narrowing with Modic endplate signal changes.  Since the prior study, there is been progression of degenerative change at L3-4 now with increased Schmorl type herniation of the superior L4 endplate and mild overall loss of height.  Remaining lumbar vertebral body heights are maintained.  Anterolisthesis of the L3 vertebral body and L4 again evident, though increased during the interval now measuring about 9 mm.  Further degrees of degenerative facet joint overgrowth.     L1-2 disc shows mild posterior annular bulging with no focal protrusion.  Canal/foramina remain patent.     L2-3 disc shows more pronounced posterolateral annular bulging with bilateral foraminal components more pronounced on the left.  Epidural fat planes remain visible adjacent both exiting L2 nerve roots.  Central thecal sac remains reasonably patent, with some narrowing of the lateral recess inlets.  Stable appearance during the interval.     Advanced degenerative facet joint overgrowth/flaval hypertrophy impinges the posterolateral thecal sac narrowing the transverse dimension of the canal, such that posterior epidural fat indents the posterior thecal sac.  Uncovering of the annulus with bilateral foraminal components more pronounced on the right.  Increased anterolisthesis.  Severe stenosis of the thecal sac now present, its anteroposterior dimension reduced to about 3 mm in the midline with effacing of CSF and compression of the cauda.  Right L3 neural foramen remain stenotic with marked attenuation of epidural fat adjacent the exiting right L3 nerve root some probable compression of the nerve root.  A thinned epidural fat plane remains visible adjacent the exiting left L3 nerve root.     Persisting broad-based disc osteophyte complex at L4-5 that indents the ventral thecal sac again with bilateral foraminal components.  Bilateral foraminal stenosis, thinned epidural fat planes remaining visible adjacent the exiting L4 nerve roots, more thinned on the left.  Degenerative facet joint overgrowth impinges the posterolateral thecal sac, with some posterior indentation of the posterior thecal sac by the posterior epidural fat.  Constellation of features results in moderate stenosis of the cyst central thecal sac in marked stenosis of the lateral recess inlets.  Anteroposterior dimension of the thecal sac measures about 7 mm in the midline with some attenuation of CSF and crowding of the cauda.     Broad-based disc osteophyte complex at L5-S1 with bilateral foraminal components.  Ventral thecal sac is minimally distorted.  Canal remains patent.  Traversing S1 nerve roots appear reasonably normal and symmetric.  Bilateral L5 neural foraminal stenosis, again with marked attenuation of epidural fat adjacent both exiting L5 nerve roots particularly on the right.  Visualized upper sacral canal/foramina remain patent.     Opinion:     L3 spondylolisthesis has increased somewhat during the interval.  Discopathy/facetopathy at L3-4 now results in severe stenosis of the thecal sac.  Surgical follow-up may be prudent.  Increased Schmorl type herniation of the superior L4 endplate has also occurred during the interval.  Ongoing stenosis of the L3, L4, and L5 neural foramina as detailed.",0

Â   L4-5:  No disc bulge.  No spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing.  Â   L5-S1:  There is mild disc height loss with some shallow broad-based posterior disc bulge.  This does not resulting in any significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing.  There may be contacting the traversing left S1 nerve root, but no significant nerve root impingement.  Mild bilateral facet degenerative changes are evident.  Â   Sacroiliac joints are unremarkable.  Articular surfaces are maintained with no erosions or ankylosis evident.  No periarticular bone marrow edema to suggest ongoing sacroiliitis.  No joint effusions demonstrated.

878,"Reason for Exam: R/O CAUDA EQINA-SENSORY LOSS/PARESTHESIAS-C2           ******** ADDENDUM #1 ********     The CT chest from May 28, 2019 and CT abdomen/pelvis from May 29, 2019 (both performed at UAH) were reviewed. The multiple small lytic lesions with sclerotic rims scattered within the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae, sacrum and left and right ilium on the CT studies demonstrate subtle central hypointense T1 and heterogenous T2 signal. Some lesions have a subtle rim of T1 hyperintensity at their periphery. The MR appearance is nonspecific. Infectious, granulomatous and malignant etiologies would have to be considered in the differential. A PET/CT scan may be of benefit to determine if these lesions are metabolically active and assess for a potential site for biopsy.    HISTORY:   As above.     TECHNIQUE:   Large field-of-view sagittal T1 and T2 imaging of the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine was first obtained. Sagittal T2 imaging of the lumbar spine and axial T1 and T2 imaging from L2-3 to L5-S1 was then acquired.     FINDINGS:  Lumbar spine x-rays from May 2013 2019 (Grey Nuns Hospital), thoracic spine x-rays from May 9, 2019 (MIC Tawa Centre) and cervical spine x-rays from May 1, 2017 (Insight Medical Imaging) were reviewed.     CERVICAL SPINE:  Straightening of the cervical spine noted. Vertebral body heights are maintained. Prevertebral soft tissues, craniocervical junction and visualized posterior fossa structures are unremarkable. Marrow signal is unremarkable.     There is mild soft tissue prominence posterior to the odontoid, indenting the ventral thecal sac but not causing any spinal cord impingement. This is of doubtful significance. The odontoid itself is intact with no erosions or osseous destruction apparent. Atlanto-dental interval is normal.     The cervical spinal cord is normal. No spinal stenosis at any level.     Moderate disc space narrowing and small posterior disc-osteophyte complex noted at C5-6. This does not affect the spinal cord. Probable mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing at this level. NO significant degenerative changes in the remainder of the cervical spine.        THORACIC SPINE:  Alignment is unremarkable. Prevertebral soft tissues are unremarkable. Small Schmorl's nodes noted at some levels. No focal destructive osseous lesions.     Thoracic spinal cord and conus are normal. Conus terminates at the T12 level. No fatty filum terminale.     Small posterior disc-osteophyte complexes at the T7-8, T9-10, T10-11, T11-12 and T12-L1 levels indent the thecal sac but do not affect the spinal cord or exiting nerve roots. No significant spinal stenosis or neural foraminal stenosis at any level.        LUMBAR SPINE:  Five lumbar type vertebrae are present. There is ventral downsloping of the superior endplate of L1, which appears remote. There is mild downsloping of the superior endplate of L2 also, which also appears old. Heights of the other lumbar vertebral bodies are maintained. Moderately advanced degenerative endplate changes are present within the L3 and L4 vertebral bodies. Patchy fatty marrow within the L1 and L2 vertebral bodies and along the L5-S1 endplates is likely degenerative in etiology also.     At L1-2, there is mild loss of disc height. A small posterior disc bulge indents the thecal sac. There is no nerve root impingement or spinal stenosis. No significant neural foraminal narrowing.     At L2-3, disc height is preserved. There is diffuse hypointense T2 signal indicative of disc degeneration. A small annular disc bulge mildly indents the ventral thecal sac. There is no nerve root impingement, spinal stenosis or lateral recess narrowing. Mild bilateral facet degenerative changes.     At L3-4, there is moderate to severe loss of disc height eccentrically towards the right, associated with mild degenerative endplate changes and small anterior osteophytes. Mild bilateral facet degenerative changes and ligamentum flavum thickening noted. A small broad-based posterior disc-osteophyte complex indents the thecal sac and encroaches upon the inferior aspect of both neural foramina, more so on the right, resulting in moderate stenosis of the right neural foramen and mild narrowing of the left neural foramen. Slight narrowing of both lateral recesses noted. Slight transverse narrowing of the thecal sac but no significant spinal stenosis.     At L4-5, there is grade I anterolisthesis of 3 mm. This is likely secondary to moderate to severe bilateral facet arthropathy at this level, associated with thickening of the ligamentum flavum. Moderate-sized joint effusions noted bilaterally also. A broad-based posterior disc bulge indents the ventral thecal sac. There is an extradural lesion just above the disc level anterolaterally towards the left within the spinal canal, demonstrating heterogeneous T2 and hypointense T1 signal. This measures approximately 15 mm AP x 14 mm TR x 11 mm CC. Its etiology is unclear. It may represent an unusual perineural cyst, synovial cyst or chronic sequestered disc fragment. It compresses the thecal sac and effaces the left lateral recess, with the exiting left L4 nerve root stretched around it. Of note, this lesion was present in retrospect on a CT abdomen/pelvis study from July 5, 2017 (UAH), associated with some regional bony remodeling at that time, and similar in size. At the disc level, there   is severe stenosis of the left lateral recess, moderate narrowing of the right lateral recess, and moderate to severe spinal stenosis. Moderate to severe stenosis of the left neural foramen noted with effacement of the fat around the exiting left L4 nerve root. Mild narrowing of the right neural foramen. These findings are also similar to the 2017 CT study.     At L5-S1, there is mild loss of disc height posteriorly. There is a small shallow disc protrusion paracentrally on the left, abutting but not displacing the descending left S1 nerve root. Mild bilateral facet degenerative changes. Slight narrowing of the left lateral recess and moderate stenosis of the left neural foramen. No stenosis of the right lateral recess or right neural foramen. No spinal stenosis.     Visualized sacroiliac joints are unremarkable.     OPINION:  1. Normal spinal cord.     2. Mild degenerative changes of the cervical and thoracic spine.     3. Multilevel degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine. Unusual extradural lesion at the inferior L4 level anterolaterally towards the left, compressing the thecal sac and narrowing the left lateral recess. This is of uncertain etiology but appears grossly unchanged in size compared to a CT abdomen/pelvis study from 2017. Differential diagnosis includes a synovial cyst, atypical perineural cyst or chronic sequestered disc fragment.     4. Bilateral lateral recess stenoses (left greater than right), moderate to severe spinal stenosis and moderate to severe left neural foraminal stenosis at L4-5. Moderate stenosis of the left L5-S1 neural foramen. These findings are also similar to the 2017 CT examination.",0

Additional axial imaging as necessary.     FINDINGS: Image quality is excellent.     Assuming 5 lumbar type vertebral bodies, the conus ends at the level of T12-L1. Visualized spinal cord signal is normal.     Disc desiccation at T12-L1. Intervertebral disc space preserved. No central canal or neural foraminal narrowing.     At L1-2, no central canal or neural foraminal narrowing. At L2-3, mild disc desiccation is noted but no central canal or neural foraminal narrowing.     L3-4: Intervertebral disc space preserved. Mild facet degenerative changes. No central canal or neural foraminal narrowing.     L4-5: Intervertebral disc space preserved. No central canal or neural foraminal narrowing.     L5-S1: Bilateral pars defects with 8 mm anterolisthesis of L5 on S1. Decreased intervertebral disc space with disc desiccation and circumferential disc bulge and uncovering of the posterior disc. The central canal is patent. However, due to the spondylolisthesis and uncovering of the disc, both neural foramina are mildly narrowed more pronounced on the left than on the right. The traversing nerve roots are unaffected.     Visualized SI joints are unremarkable. No significant findings elsewhere.     IMPRESSION: Spondylolysis at L5 with grade 1 anterolisthesis. Uncovering of the disc with mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing at this level. No central canal narrowing.",0
975,"Reason for Exam: LEFT L5-S1 LAMINOTOMY AND MICROSCOPIC-ASSISTED DISECTOMY DECEMBER 12, 2016.  STILL PAIN RADIATING DOWN THE LEFT LEG TO THE CALF.  DR. O'KELLY HAS REQUESTED THAT AN AUGMENTED MRI BE DONE BEFORE HE CAN SEE HER AGAIN.  ASSESS LUMBAR SPINE AND NERVES.  Â   COMPARISON: MRI lumbar spine April 30, 2018  Â   TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar multisequence MRI of the lumbar spine with and without gadolinium  Â   FINDINGS:  5 lumbar type vertebra are assumed for the purposes of this report normal termination of the conus medullaris at L1. Minor grade 1 retrolisthesis of L5 on S1, similar as in 2018. Associated Modic type I endplate signal changes about the L5-S1 disc space have slightly increased. Vertebral body heights are preserved and no suspicious marrow replacing lesions are seen.  Â   At T12-L1 through L4-5: Multiple small posterior disc herniations with tiny annular fissures at L3-4 and L4-5 but no significant spinal canal or neuroforaminal stenosis, unchanged.  Â   At L5-S1: Evidence of interval left laminotomy and discectomy. Irregular residual enhancing tissue within the left epidural space extends to abut the left S1 nerve root in the left lateral/subarticular recess. There could be some mild distortion of the nerve root. This demonstrate progressive enhancement on the later postgadolinium sequences in keeping with granulation tissue. There remains a tiny left paracentral disc protrusion, but this has significantly decreased from previous.  Â   Limited visualization and assessment of the paraspinal soft tissues demonstrates no other significant abnormalities.  Â   IMPRESSION:  Sequelae of laminotomy and discectomy at L5-S1. The previous left paracentral disc protrusion has markedly decreased in size from April 2018 and no recurrent disc protrusion is suspected. However, residual enhancing granulation tissue in the left epidural space could be causing some distortion of the left S1 nerve root within the lateral/subarticular recess.",0
