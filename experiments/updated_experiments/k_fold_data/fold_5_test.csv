3,"Narrative & Impression  MR LUMBAR SPINE     Reason for Exam: KNOWN MULTILEVEL DEGENERATIVE DISC DISEASE AND MULTILEVEL DISC BULGING GRADUAL WORSENING PAIN IN LOWER BACK WITH LT L3-4 RADICULOPATHY PREVIOUS LEUKEMIA (RECURRED 2017) PLEASE COMPARE TO 2014 MRI     Technique: Routine lumbar spine MR was performed.     Comparison with multiple previous studies including CT abdomen and pelvis from July 31, 2017, MR from October 28, 2014, radiographs from October 21, 2014 and bone scan from October 21, 2014.     FINDINGS:     Five lumbar type vertebrae were confirmed on prior radiographs.  There is mild dextroconvex lumbar curvature.  Vertebral body heights are maintained.  Minimal retrolisthesis of L1 on L2 by 0.3 cm is similar to previous.  No further malalignment is seen.  There is disc desiccation throughout the lower thoracic and lumbar spine with disc space narrowing from L2 to S1 and vacuum phenomenon at a few levels.  There is endplate spurring/osteophytosis at most levels in the lower thoracic and lumbar spine most pronounced on the left at L2-L3 with endplate irregularity and Modic changes greatest from L2 to S1.  A degree of interspinous impingement is present in the lower lumbar spine.  There is a developmentally narrow lumbar spinal canal due to short pedicles.  The conus medullaris is normally positioned at the L1 level.  There is a small central disc protrusion which focally indents the ventral aspect of the thecal sac at T11-T12 and a small right foraminal disc protrusion at T12-L1.  There   are known partially imaged right renal cortical cysts and degenerative change of the partially imaged superior SI joints.     At L1-L2: Annular disc bulging and small disc osteophyte complex which flatten the ventral aspect of the thecal sac.  Schmorl's node in the inferior endplate of L1.  Mild left neural foraminal narrowing.  No significant canal, lateral recess or right neural foraminal narrowing.  At L2-L3: Diffuse disc bulge and disc osteophyte complex asymmetrically larger on the left which indent the ventral aspect of the thecal sac.  Together with mild facet and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy, this results in moderate left and mild right neural foraminal narrowing.  No significant canal or lateral recess narrowing.  At L3-L4: Diffuse disc bulge and disc osteophyte complex asymmetrically larger on the left with superimposed small left paracentral disc protrusion which indent the ventral aspect of the thecal sac.  Together with ligamentum flavum thickening and mild to moderate facet degenerative change, this results in mild right and mild to moderate left neural foraminal narrowing and slight narrowing of the left lateral recess.  No significant canal or right lateral recess narrowing.  At L4-L5: Diffuse disc bulge and disc osteophyte complex with superimposed small right paracentral disc protrusion which indent the ventral aspect of the thecal sac.  Together with ligamentum flavum thickening and moderate to advanced facet degenerative change, this results in severe canal narrowing with effacement of the periradicular CSF, central crowding of the cauda equina nerve roots and reduced AP diameter of the thecal sac which measures 0.5 to 0.6 cm.  There is moderate narrowing of the right lateral recess with the transiting right L5 nerve root interposed between the facet and disc material and moderate left and mild-to-moderate right neural foraminal narrowing.  No significant left lateral recess narrowing.  At L5-S1: Diffuse disc bulge and disc osteophyte complex with superimposed tiny left paracentral disc protrusion which flatten the ventral aspect of the thecal sac.  Together with moderate to advanced facet degenerative change, this results in moderate to severe bilateral neural foraminal narrowing with possible compression of the exiting L5 nerve roots as well as slight narrowing of the right lateral recess.  No significant canal or left lateral recess narrowing.     IMPRESSION: Progression of multilevel degenerative disc disease, endplate degenerative change, facet arthropathy and ligamentum flavum thickening.  The most salient abnormality is the presence of severe multifactorial canal stenosis at L4-L5.  There is also neural foraminal narrowing of varying degrees at several levels as outlined above most pronounced at L5-S1 where there is possible compromise of the exiting L5 nerve roots along with slight narrowing of the left lateral recess at L3-L4, slight narrowing of the right lateral recess at L5-S1 and moderate narrowing of the right lateral recess at L4-L5 with possible irritation or impingement upon the transiting right L5 nerve root.  Other findings as outlined above.",0
6,"MRI lumbar spine     Comparison: No prior     Technique: Routine MRI of the lumbar spine     FINDINGS:  Assuming 5 lumbar type vertebral bodies, a normal conus medullaris terminates at T12-L1.     There is normal alignment of the lumbar spine.     Normal vertebral body heights.. No focal concerning bone lesion.     At L2-3 there is bilateral facet joint arthropathy.  No significant disc degeneration.  Spinal canal and neural foramina are patent.     At L3-4 there is bilateral facet joint arthropathy.  Minimal disc degeneration.  Spinal canal and neural foramina are patent.     At L4-5 there is mild disc degeneration with a shallow generalized disc bulge.  Moderate bilateral facet joint arthropathy.

Right neural foramen is patent.     No other significant degenerative change and/or spinal canal stenosis at any of the other levels.     Visualized retroperitoneum and the paravertebral musculature are unremarkable.     SUMMARY:  Multilevel mild degenerative change.  Of note at L5 S1 1a  left paracentral disc protrusion effaces the left lateral recess with posterior deviation of the transiting left S1 nerve which is likely impinged.     Other findings elsewhere.  No spinal canal stenosis.",0
19," -MRI Lumbar Spine without Contrast  PREVIOUS:  NONE.  HISTORY:  As above.  TECHNIQUE:  Routine MRI of the lumbar spine  FINDINGS:  This study is slightly limited by artifact relating to patient's large body habitus. There is a  transversely oriented band of T2 hypointense signal across the anterior aspect of the  thecal sac on the axial T2 weighted sequences. This is favored to relate to artifact rather  than true pathology.  There is prominent epidural fat within the epidural space in keeping with a component of  epidural lipomatosis. This is most conspicuous from approximately L3 to the sacrum.  Conus demonstrates normal signal and position. Vertebral body heights are maintained.  T12-L1: Mild degenerative facet changes are demonstrated. No significant disc bulge,  central canal stenosis, or foraminal stenosis is demonstrated.  L1-L2: Mild circumferential disc bulge is demonstrated. Moderate degenerative facet  changes are demonstrated. No significant central canal or foraminal stenosis is  demonstrated. There is mild narrowing of the left lateral recess raising the possibility of  impingement upon the downward traversing left L2 nerve root.  L2-L3: Mild circumferential disc bulge is demonstrated. Moderate degenerative facet  changes are demonstrated. Minimal bilateral foraminal stenosis is noted. No significant  central canal stenosis.  L3-4: A moderate circumferential disc bulge is demonstrated. Moderate to advanced  degenerative facet changes are present. There is moderate to advanced central canal  stenosis. This is exacerbated by the prominent epidural fat. There is resulting  essentially complete effacement of the CSF surrounding the nerve roots. There is  narrowing of the right lateral recess raising the possibility of impingement upon the downward traversing right L4 nerve root. There is moderate right foraminal stenosis.  Mild left foraminal stenosis.  L4-5: A mild circumferential disc bulge is demonstrated. Mild to moderate degenerative  facet changes are demonstrated. No significant central canal stenosis is demonstrated.  There is narrowing of the lateral recesses bilaterally raising the possibility of  impingement upon the downward traversing nerve roots. No significant foraminal  stenosis is demonstrated.  L5-S1: Mild circumferential disc bulge is demonstrated. Crescentic T2 hyperintense  signal is present within the left posterolateral aspect of the disc in keeping with a tiny  annular fissure. Mild degenerative facet changes are demonstrated. There is mild  central canal narrowing. No significant foraminal stenosis.  IMPRESSION:  Multilevel degenerative changes are present within the lumbar spine, most pronounced  at L3-4 as described above. At L3-4, there is moderate to advanced central canal  stenosis.  Given the provided clinical history of weakness, spinal surgery opinion is likely  warranted.",0
20,"MRI Lumbar Spine without Contrast  MRI LUMBAR SPINE:  History: Sciatica right side L5 distribution  Protocol: Routine lumbar spine with sagittal T2, sagittal T1 and axial T2 sequences.  FINDINGS:  Five lumbar type vertebrae demonstrate grossly unremarkable alignment. For the  purposes of this report, the lowest free vertebrae is labeled L5. Marrow signal is  normal. The conus terminates normally at L1.  The lower thoracic spine demonstrates no significant abnormality. No concerning  extraspinal abnormality.  L1-2: The intervertebral disc space is maintained. There is a broad-based disc bulge  which indents the thecal sac anteriorly but no compromise of the exiting or descending  nerve roots.  L2-3: Very mild narrowing of intervertebral disc space. Broad-based disc bulge indents  the thecal sac anteriorly but no compromise the exiting or descending nerve roots.  Small synovial cyst seen posteriorly off the left facet.  L3-4: The intervertebral disc spaces maintained. There is a broad-based disc bulge  which flattens the thecal sac anteriorly results in mild narrowing of the central canal. No  definite compromise the exiting or descending nerve roots. Mild to moderate  degenerative facet changes are present.  L4-5: The intervertebral disc spaces maintained. There is a broad-based disc  protrusion which flattens the thecal sac anteriorly. This in conjunction with moderate  degenerative facet changes, hypertrophy ligamentum flavum results in moderate to  severe narrowing of the central canal and a mild degree of the lateral recess stenosis is  well.  L5-S1: There is mild narrowing of the intervertebral disc space. Posterior disc  osteophytic bulge is present. The thecal sac is mildly narrowed at this level secondary  to some epidural fat. The canal itself appears patent. There is moderate degenerative facet changes present. There is abutment of the exiting L5 nerve root on the right and  extraforaminal location no impingement identified of the exiting left L5 nerve root or the  descending L1 nerve roots.  IMPRESSION:  There is multilevel degenerative disc and facet changes. This is more severe in the  lower lumbar spine which results in mild narrowing of the central canal at L3-4 and  severe narrowing of the central canal at L4-5 with possible impingement of the  descending nerve roots at this level. At L5-S1 there is a more asymmetric disc  protrusion extraforaminal on the right which abuts the exiting right L5 nerve root.",0
26,"Clinical History: LUMBAR PAIN WITH RADIATION L LEG.       Comparison: CT lumbar spine performed August 30, 2019       Findings:       There are 5 lumbar-type vertebral bodies. The vertebral body heights are normal. There are vertebral body hemangiomas seen within  T12 and S1. The conus terminates at the superior endplate of L2. There are Tarlov cysts seen abutting the S2 and S3 segments.       T11-12: Normal    T12-L1: Normal    L1-2: Normal    L2-3: Normal    L3-4: There is a broad-based posterior disc bulge at L3-4. There is no central canal stenosis. The facet joints are normal. There  is mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing.    L4-5: There is grade 1 anterolisthesis and a posterior disc bulge. There is mild central canal stenosis at this level however CSF  continues to surround the nerve roots. There is mild right neural foraminal narrowing. There is facet hypertrophy.    L5-S1: A left sided eccentric broad-based posterior disc bulge impinges on the left lateral recess and impinges on the left S1   nerve root. There is severe left neural foraminal narrowing. The facet joints are within normal limits. The right neuroforamen   remains patent.       Impression:       Left eccentric disc bulge at L5-S1 results in left lateral recess narrowing and left neuroforaminal narrowing. This likely   results in left S1 nerve impingement.       Mild central canal stenosis at L4-5 due to grade 1 anterolisthesis and facet hypertrophy. CSF continues to surround the nerve   roots.     ",0

There is narrowing of the C5-6 intervertebral disc.  Annular bulging and broad-based posterior protrusion with posterior marginal osteophytes.  Combined disc osseous complex encroach on the central canal with encroachment on the adjacent spinal cord.  Unfortunately signal intensity is not optimal at this level but there is some degree of flattening of the cervical spinal cord.  No obvious myelomalacia.     There is minor compression fracture involving the superior endplates of T4 with no associated marrow edema likely long-standing.  There is fusion anteriorly at the T10-T11 level with a rudimentary disc interspace posteriorly.  The alignment of the posterior margins the vertebral bodies is maintained.  There is alteration the signal intensity associated with the T10 and T11 vertebral bodies and there are Modic endplate changes present at the T9-10 level as well as at the T12-L1 level.      T7-8 level: Shallow central posterior protrusion of the T7-8 intervertebral disc with minor encroachment on the anterior aspect of the thecal sac but no compression of the adjacent spinal cord.     T8-9 level: There is narrowing and desiccation of the T8-9 intervertebral disc.

There is some degree of thinning of the spinal cord at the T8-9 and T9-10 levels.     T9-10 level: There is narrowing and desiccation of the T9-10 intervertebral disc.  There is focal protrusion of the T9-10 intervertebral disc identified and there is a large calcific or ossific body arising centered on the disc interspace.  This measures approximately 10 x 9 x 14 mm.  There is significant encroachment on the central canal and there is flattening of the spinal cord.  Very minor increased signal intensity identified suggesting minor myelomalacia.

Marrow signal is somewhat heterogenous but no concerning lesion.   There are predominantly areas of T1 and T2 hyperintensity in keeping with fatty replacement. The conus medullaris is normally   located. Paraspinal musculature and partially visualized retroperitoneal structures normal.       At the T11-12 level, mild disc bulge impressing minimally on the thecal sac but no significant spinal stenosis.       T12-L1: Diffuse disc bulge.  Mild impression on the thecal sac but no significant spinal stenosis.. There is mild facet   degenerative change present.       L1-2: Diffuse disc bulge.  Mild impression on the thecal sac but no significant spinal stenosis.. There is mild facet   degenerative change present.       L2-3: Minimal disc bulge.. There is mild facet degenerative change present.  Spinal canal and neural foramen are widely patent.       L3-4: Diffuse disc bulge.. Moderate degenerative changes are noted in the facet joints.  There is ligamentum flavum hypertrophy.   Combination results in mild impression on the thecal sac but there is not significant spinal stenosis.  No nerve root impingement.       L4-5: Severe facet degenerative changes with resultant 9 mm of anterolisthesis of L4 on L5.  Ligamentum flavum hypertrophy and   facet overgrowth in combination with the spondylolisthesis does result in impression on the thecal sac with clumping of the nerve   roots and severe spinal stenosis.  There is narrowing of both neural foramen but nerve roots are not clearly impinged upon.    Lateral recesses are severely narrowed..       L5-S1: Diffuse disc bulge.  Moderate facet degenerative changes.  No significant spinal stenosis.  Narrowing of both neural   foramen left greater than right and there may be impingement on the exiting left S1 nerve root.        IMPRESSION:       Multilevel degenerative disc disease as described above.  There is severe facet degenerative changes at the L4-5 level with   resultant grade 1 anterolisthesis of L4 on L5.  This does result in severe spinal stenosis at this level as well as severe   narrowing of the lateral recesses.              ",1

The cord and exiting nerve roots are free of compression.     At the C3-4 level there is some posterior disc bulging which narrows the anterior aspect of the thecal sac but the cord and exiting nerve roots are free of compression.     At the C4-5 level there is some bony hypertrophy in the uncovertebral joints bilaterally resulting in some mild foraminal encroachment but no definite exiting nerve root compression.  There is some narrowing of the anterior aspect of the thecal sac but the cord is free of compression.     At the C5-6 level there is a moderate to large right paracentral disc protrusion along with an annular tear.  This causes moderate severe compression of the cord particularly on the right side and causes severe compression of the exiting right nerve root as it enters the foramina.  There is moderate severe foraminal encroachment bilaterally causing bilateral exiting nerve root compressions as they pass through the foramina.     At the C6-7 level there is a moderate to large posterior and left paracentral disc protrusion.  This causes moderate compression of the cord particularly on the left side.

The vertebral body heights are relatively well-maintained allowing for Schmorl's node formation associated with the endplates throughout the lumbar region and are stable in appearance when compared with the prior study performed in September of 2014. The bone marrow signal is fairly homogeneous allowing for hemangiomata/fatty rests as well as degenerative endplate changes at several levels. There is evidence for a prior posterior decompression procedure at the L4 level with associated postoperative changes within the overlying soft tissues posterior to the osseous spinal column. The conus medullaris terminates normally at approximately the L1 level.     At the S1/2 level, an underdeveloped disc is noted. No significant neural foraminal compromise or compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.     At the L5/S1 level, a prominent anterior osteophyte is noted straddling the midline. Moderate degenerative endplate changes are present along with moderate-to-advanced narrowing of the intervertebral disc. A trace amount of vacuum phenomenon is suspected within the intervertebral disc. Disc/osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline which extends laterally protruding into the inferior aspect of the neural foramen bilaterally. A minuscule focus of abnormal increased T2 signal is present within the disc annulus posteriorly to the right of midline, compatible with an annular fissure. Degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints, mild-to-moderate on the left and mild on the right. The findings are resulting in moderate-to-severe compromise of the right neural foramen and moderate compromise of the left neural foramen. No significant compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.     At the L4/5 level, moderate degenerative endplate changes are present, more prominent eccentric to the left. Narrowing of the intervertebral disc is present, fairly advanced on the left and moderate on the right. Disc/osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline which extends laterally protruding into the inferior aspect of the neural foramen bilaterally. The posterior disc/osteophyte complex appears to involve the traversing L5 nerve root bilaterally, more prominent on the left side. Moderate degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints. There is hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum. The findings are resulting in moderate compromise of the adjacent thecal sac as well as severe compromise of the right neural foramen and moderate inferior neural foraminal compromise on the left. Subtle clumping of the nerve roots is noted within the thecal sac at this level, raising the possibility of arachnoiditis.     At the L3/4 level, moderate degenerative endplate changes are present, more prominent eccentric to the left. Narrowing of the intervertebral disc is present, advanced on the left and moderate-to-advanced on the right. Disc/osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline which extends laterally protruding into the inferior aspect of the neural foramen bilaterally, slightly more striking on the left side. A superimposed small disc extrusion persists posteriorly straddling the midline, but more prominent to the left of midline, which has diminished in size when compared with the prior study and likely involves the traversing L4 nerve root. Mild degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints. The findings are resulting in the severe compromise of the left neural foramen and mild-to-moderate compromise of the right neural foramen as well as minimal/mild compromise of the adjacent thecal sac.     At the L2/3 level, a prominent anterior osteophyte is noted straddling the midline. Moderate degenerative endplate changes are present, more prominent eccentric to the right. Narrowing of the intervertebral disc is present, advanced on the right and moderate on the left. Disc/osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline which extends laterally protruding into the inferior aspect of the neural foramen bilaterally. A minuscule focus of abnormal increased T2 signal is noted within the disc annulus posteriorly, compatible with an annular fissure. The posterior disc/osteophyte complex appears to contact but not significantly displace the traversing L3 nerve roots. Mild-to-moderate degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints. The findings are resulting in moderate compromise of the left neural foramen and mild compresses of the right neural foramen. No significant compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.     At the L1/2 level, a small anterior osteophyte is noted straddling the midline. Mild degenerative endplate changes are present along with mild-to-moderate narrowing of the intervertebral disc. A minuscule shallow disc protrusion is present posteriorly in the midline which does not appear to involve the traversing L2 nerve roots. Minor disc/osteophyte complex is present laterally protruding into the inferior aspect of the right neural foramen. Mild degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints. The findings are resulting in minimal compromise of the right neural foramen. The left neural foramen is patent and no significant compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.     The remainder of the visualized levels are unremarkable allowing for at least mild degenerative facet joint changes.     Atheromatous irregularity is present throughout the abdominal aorta extending into the iliac arteries bilaterally. Diffuse atrophic change is present involving the posterior paraspinal musculature, most prominent inferior to the L4/5 level. To the extent visualized, the regional soft tissue structures are otherwise unremarkable.     IMPRESSION:     Findings compatible with the prior posterior decompression procedure at the L4 level. Degenerative changes are present involving the intervertebral disc and the facet joints at multiple levels resulting in neural foraminal compromise at several levels as well as moderate compromise of the thecal sac/spinal canal at the L4/5 level, as detailed above. The degenerative disc and facet joint changes as well as the resultant neural foraminal compromise have progressed since the prior study performed 19 September, 2014. The degree of compromise of the thecal sac at the L4/5 level also appears to have slightly progressed when compared with the prior study performed 19 September, 2014.     A disc extrusion persists posteriorly straddling the midline, but more prominent to the left of midline at the L3/L4 level which has diminished in size with less resultant compromise of the adjacent thecal sac when compared with the prior study performed 19 September, 2014.       ",0

Compared with plain film from October 3, 2018     TECHNIQUE:     Sagittal T1, T2 and axial medic sequences.     FINDINGS:     There is loss of the normal cervical lordosis. Minor degenerative height loss involving the superior endplate of C6. Cervical vertebral body heights and alignment are otherwise preserved. The cervical spinal cord is normal in signal.           At C2-3, moderate right facet degenerative changes demonstrated with mild right foraminal stenosis.     At C3-4, broad-based disc osteophyte complex indents the ventral thecal sac with small amount of CSF surrounding the cord. Right more than left facet and bilateral uncovertebral degenerative change causes right more than left foraminal stenosis.     At C4-5, broad-based disc osteophyte complex indents the ventral thecal sac and abuts the ventral cord effacing the ventral and dorsal CSF suggesting mild spinal canal stenosis. Uncovertebral degenerative changes are demonstrated left slightly more than right causing mild left more than right foraminal stenosis.     At C5-6, broad-based disc osteophyte complex effaces the ventral and dorsal CSF and abuts the ventral cord causing mild contouring of the ventral cord suggesting mild to moderate acquired spinal canal stenosis. Uncovertebral degenerative changes cause bilateral foraminal stenosis. This is noted greater on the left side.     At C6-7 right eccentric disc osteophyte complex effaces the ventral and dorsal CSF and minorly contours the right ventral cord suggesting mild spinal canal stenosis. Uncovertebral degenerative changes are present bilaterally subtly greater on the right causing right greater than left foraminal stenosis.     At C7-T1, there is right paracentral and medial foraminal disc protrusion which may cause some compression on the exiting right C8 nerve root. No spinal or left foraminal stenosis.     IMPRESSION:     Small right paracentral and medial foraminal disc protrusion at C7-T1 which may affect the exiting right C8 nerve root possibly accounting for the patient's symptoms.     Mild spinal canal stenosis primarily at C5-6 and to a lesser degree at C4-5 and C6-7. No cervical cord signal change is demonstrated.",0

657,"FINDINGS: A mild broad-based rightward curvature of the spine is similar to previous radiographs. There  is straightening of lordosis above L4. Vertebral body height is preserved and background marrow signal is  normal. The distal end of the spinal cord is normal in signal, caliber and position. No significant  spondylosis is seen above L2 in the lumbar and included lower thoracic spine.  At L2-L3, there is disc desiccation with minimal-mild disc height loss. There is minimal-mild posterior disc  bulging and there is moderate to severe facet degeneration, but the spinal canal and intervertebral  foramina are widely patent.  At L3-L4, there is disc desiccation with mild overall disc height loss. There is at least mild circumferential  disc bulging with mild retrolisthesis. Moderate facet degeneration is present and there is mild to moderate  narrowing of the lateral recess of the canal, but without nerve root impingement/compression. The  central canal is widely patent. Only mild foraminal narrowing.  At L4-L5, there is disc desiccation with moderate disc height loss and mild retrolisthesis. Moderate  circumferential disc bulging is seen along with at least moderate facet degeneration. Bilateral facet joint  effusion is seen. The central canal is widely patent, but there is mild narrowing of the lateral recesses and  foramina. No nerve root compression/impingement.  At L5-S1, there is disc desiccation with moderate to severe disc height loss seen more so posteriorly.  There is mild posterior disc bulging seen more so toward the right side and there is moderate facet  degeneration. Mild narrowing of the lateral recess of the spinal canal is more pronounced on the right,  but the central canal is widely patent. Mild foraminal narrowing is noted on the right. No nerve root compression.  IMPRESSION:  There is overall at least moderate degenerative lumbar spondylosis, particularly below the L2 level and  with multilevel mild retrolisthesis and with mildly altered curvature. Although there is some narrowing of  lateral recesses of the spinal canal, there does not appear to be significant narrowing of the central canal.  There is only mild foraminal narrowing.

713,"Narrative & Impression  MR LUMBAR SPINE      Reason for Exam: SPINAL STENOSIS WITH CLAUDICATION, KNOWN L4/5 ANTEROLISTHESIS AND MOTION STABILITY. PREVIOUS L4/5 DECOMPRESSION X 2.      HISTORY: Spinal stenosis with claudication, known L4/5 anterolisthesis and motion instability.  Previous L4/5 decompression x2.     TECHNIQUE: Sagittal T1 and T2 sequences through the entire lumbar spine and axial T1 and T2 sequences through the lower 4 disc levels.     COMPARISON: MRI lumbar spine from October 4, 2016.     FINDINGS     This report assumes 5 lumbar vertebral bodies.  Vertebral body heights are maintained.  Allowing for endplate degenerative changes and small hemangiomata, no significant marrow signal abnormality is identified.     The visualized portion of the retroperitoneum is within normal limits.  Mild increased heterogenous T1 and T2 signal within the posterior paraspinal musculature at the L4 and L5 levels is likely related to previous surgery.  No fluid collection or abscess within the paraspinal musculature.     The conus terminates at the level T12-L1, within normal limits.  The visualized portion of the lower thoracic and upper lumbar spine demonstrates normal disc signal evidence of significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing.     At L2-3 there is mild loss of disc space height.  There is broad-based anterior and posterior disc bulging, as well as a more focal disc posterior disc protrusion centrally.  Mild facet joint hypertrophy.  This results in moderate to severe narrowing of the central canal, minimally progressed compared to 2016.  Mild narrowing of the bilateral neural foramen.     At L3-4 there has been previous bilateral laminectomy and resection of the ligamentum flavum.  There is a broad-based nearly circumferential disc bulge.  Mild facet joint hypertrophy.  There is no significant narrowing of the spinal canal.  There is mild-moderate narrowing of the bilateral neural foramen, unchanged from previous.     At L4-5 there has been previous bilateral laminectomies and resection of the ligamentum flavum.  There is also a history of right lateral recess decompression at this level.  There is near complete loss of disc space height with moderate endplate degenerative changes.  Anterolisthesis of L4 on L5 by up to 8 mm is increased which prior MR in 2016.  Large broad-based posterior disc bulge.  Moderate facet joint hypertrophy.  There is mild narrowing of the spinal canal and severe narrowing of the bilateral neural foramen, not significantly changed from 2016.     At L5-S1 there is a posterolateral disc protrusions bilaterally, right greater then left.  Mild facet joint hypertrophy.  No significant narrowing of the spinal canal.  Mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing.     IMPRESSION     Multilevel degenerative changes, with post surgical changes at the L3-4 and L4-5 levels.  There is persistent severe bilateral foraminal narrowing at the L4-5 level.  Moderate-severe narrowing of the spinal canal at the L2-3 level has minimally progressed since 2016.",0
724,"Clinical indication: Severe lower back, left hip pain, physiotherapy, cortisone injection did not help.  Pain radiating to the left lower leg, has numbness both feet.  EMG normal.     Technique: Routine MRI of the lumbar spine     Comparison: Radiograph November 15, 2019.  A remote MRI of the lumbar spine from December 29, 2005 is also noted.     Findings:  Conventional lumbosacral transition. With this designation and normal conus medullaris is positioned at L1-2.  No vertebral body compression fracture.  Bone marrow signal unremarkable.     No significant degenerative changes are noted along the lower thoracic segments or at the thoracolumbar junction.     No significant degenerative changes at L1-2 or L2-3.     L3-4 there is minimal disc degeneration.  No significant disc bulge.  Mild facet joint arthropathy.  Spinal canal and neural foramina are patent.     At L4-5 there is mild disc degeneration and moderate facet joint arthropathy with ligamentum flavum hypertrophy.  Spinal canal uninvolved.  Minimal narrowing of both lateral angles but with no evidence for transiting nerve root impingement.  Neural foramina are patent.     At L5-S1 there is evidence for a previous right-sided laminotomy.  There is mild disc degeneration with a tiny focal central disc protrusion containing a tiny annular fissure.  Mild bilateral facet joint arthropathy.  Spinal canal and neural foramina are patent.     Paravertebral musculature in the visualized retroperitoneum are unremarkable.     Summary:  Stigmata prior right L5-S1 laminotomy.  Mild scattered degenerative changes involving the lumbar spine.  No neural compromise.",0
726,"MRI OF THE LUMBAR SPINE       Technique:  Sagittal and axial T1 and T2 weighted images, as well as sagittal T2 FS images.       Comparison study : CT lumbar spine September 6, 2019 and radiograph lumbar spine June 7, 2019.       FINDINGS:  There is a gentle levoconvex curvature on the coronal localizer.  On the sagittal images there is again minor   anterolisthesis of L4 on L5 secondary to degenerative disease with no spondylolysis.  The alignment is otherwise satisfactory.    The lumbar vertebral body heights are relatively well-maintained.       There is at least moderate disc space narrowing at L1-2, L3-4 and L5-S1 with mild narrowing at the remaining levels.  There is   disc desiccation throughout the lumbar levels.       Aside from degenerative endplate changes the bone marrow signal is otherwise within normal limits.       The tip of the conus is at the upper endplate of L1.  No lesions of the distal cord are seen.       The thoracic spine is visualized up to T9-10.  No significant lower thoracic disc protrusion or Central narrowing.       L1-2: There is mild generalized disc bulging with mild flattening of the anterior aspect of the thecal sac.

909,"COMPARISON: Previous MRI April 16/13 (UAH) and x-ray October 3/12 (Slave Lake Healthcare Centre).      TECHNIQUE: Routine non-augmented L-spine radiculopathy protocol.      FINDINGS:   5 lumbar type vertebral bodies are identified, as on prior plain radiograph. Conus medullaris is therefore noted to terminate normally at L1-2. There is focal kyphosis at the L1 level. This is secondary to a remote compression fracture of the L1 vertebral body. Approximately 45% loss of height anteriorly is seen, stable from previous.      T12-L1 is unremarkable. No stenosis seen.      L1-2 demonstrates mild circumferential disc bulge. Minimal degenerative facet joint changes seen bilaterally. Mild central spinal stenosis is seen, similar to previous. No significant stenosis noted at this level.      L2-3 is unremarkable, as assessed on sagittal sequences.      L3-4 demonstrates mild degenerative facet joint change bilaterally. No significant stenosis seen at this level.      L4-5 demonstrates minimal posterior disc bulge. Mild degenerative facet joint changes are seen bilaterally. No significant stenosis seen.      L5-S1 demonstrates a central disc protrusion. This indents the anterior aspect of the thecal sac, resulting in mild central spinal stenosis. Appearances are unchanged from previous. Mild degenerative facet joint changes are also seen bilaterally. No other significant stenosis seen at this level.      There is partial visualization of the sacrum demonstrating old healed fracture through the right sacral alla.      IMPRESSION: Previous fractures of the L1 vertebral body and right sacral alla.

Mild anterior wedging of the T8, T9, and T10 vertebral bodies is similar to the prior CT study of January 28, 2019.  Multilevel endplate degenerative changes with undulation of the endplates within the mid/lower thoracic spine associated with small Schmorl's nodes are also again noted.  An exaggeration of the thoracic kyphosis centered at T8/9 is also similar to the prior CT study.  There is otherwise normal alignment of the vertebral bodies and facet joints.     On the localizer images, prominent T2 hyperintensity within the L5 vertebral body may relate to an underlying hemangioma. Small superior Schmorl's nodes are also noted at L5 and S1.     Focal ventral distortion of the thoracic spinal cord is noted at the level of T8, abutting the T8 vertebral body.  The posterior aspect of the thoracic spinal cord at the level of T8 has a focally angulated appearance.  Abnormal T2 hyperintensity is noted within the thoracic spinal cord at the level of T8 extending to the level of T9.     Hypertrophic degenerative facet arthropathy is contributing to mild neural foraminal narrowing at T11/12.  No other significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing throughout the thoracic spine.     IMPRESSION:  Appearances are compatible with a spinal cord herniation at the level of T8.
