17,"MR LUMBAR SPINE  HISTORY: No history provided on requisition.  Technologist obtained history - Right-sided radiculopathy symptoms since February 5, 2020.  TECHNIQUE: Routine MRI lumbar spine (sagittal T2, sagittal T1, sagittal STIR, axial T2/T1).  COMPARISON: Radiograph January 27, 2020.  FINDINGS: 5 lumbar-type vertebral bodies are assumed. The vertebral body heights are maintained.  Conus medullaris terminates approximately at L1, within normal limits. Abnormal marrow signal.  Heterogeneous patchy decreased T1/T2 signal is seen throughout the spine. No acute compression  fracture is identified.  Multilevel disc desiccation, extending from L1 to S1.  T12-L1: No spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis.  L1-L2: There is mild circumferential disc bulging. There is no spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis.  L2-L3: No spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis.  L3-L4: There is mild circumferential disc bulging. There is no spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis.  Minor facet arthropathy.  L4-L5: Broad based circumferential disc bulging. A small right superimposed lateral recess/foraminal zone  disc extrusion is noted. The extruded disc material contacts the traversing right L5 nerve root within the  lateral recess, with possible impingement in region of the ligamentum flavum.  Disc material also possibly contacts the traversing left L5 nerve root, without evidence of impingement.    There is mild ligamentum flavum hypertrophy and mild facet arthropathy. No significant spinal canal  stenosis. Mild right neural foraminal narrowing. Left neural foramen is patent.  L5-S1: Severe disc space narrowing. Small broad based disc osteophyte complex which abuts the ventral  thecal sac. No significant resultant spinal canal stenosis. Mild bilateral facet arthropathy. Mild-moderate  right and mild-moderate left neural foraminal stenosis.  There is a T1 hyperintense-T2 hypointense triangular shaped focus along the posterolateral aspect of the  midpole right kidney measuring approximately 1.4 x 1.4 cm (TR/AP). This could represent a focus of  cortical scarring.  IMPRESSION:  1. At L4-L5, broad based disc bulging with superimposed small right paracentral disc protrusion which  results in narrowing of the right lateral recess. Disc material contacts and possibly impinges the traversing  right L5 nerve root in the lateral recess, near region of the ligamentum flavum.  2. At L5-S1, severe degenerative disc disease with no significant spinal canal stenosis. Mild-to-moderate  bilateral neural foraminal stenosis.  3. No severe spinal canal stenosis in the lumbar spine.  4. Abnormal marrow signal. There is heterogeneous diffuse replacement of normal fatty marrow signal.  Findings are not entirely specific and may be secondary to a number of different etiologies including  leukemia/lymphoma, myeloma, or diffuse metastases. Review of Netcare notes that a flow cytometry  performed on October 19, 2017 demonstrates findings consistent with T-cell large granular lymphocytic  leukemia. Findings, thus, can be secondary to leukemia. Clinical correlation is advised.  5. There is a small T1 hyperintense/T2 hypointense focus along the posterolateral aspect of the midpole right kidney. Differential considerations include a hemorrhagic/proteinaceous cyst, or possibly a focus of cortical scarring. This is, however, incompletely characterized.",0

Alignment is normal. Vertebral body heights are maintained. Marrow signal is unremarkable. Mild degenerative changes within the inferior endplate of L5. Prevertebral soft tissues are unremarkable.     Conus medullaris is normal, terminating at the upper L2 level. No fatty filum terminale.     The T11-12, T12-L1, L1-2 and L2-3 discs are unremarkable. No spinal stenosis or neural foraminal stenosis at these levels.     At L3-4, disc height is preserved. Hypointense T2 disc signal reflects disc degeneration. A small shallow central disc protrusion with tiny annular fissure indents the thecal sac. No nerve root impingement, spinal stenosis or neural foraminal stenosis. Facet joints are unremarkable.     At L4-5, disc height is maintained. Diffuse hypointense T2 disc signal noted. A small shallow central disc protrusion mildly indents the ventral thecal sac. A 7 mm T2 hyperintense annular fissure is present within the protruded disc. No impingement of the descending or exiting nerve roots. No spinal stenosis, neural foraminal stenosis or significant lateral recess narrowing. Facet joints are unremarkable. Mild ligamentum flavum thickening.     At L5-S1, disc height is maintained. Diffuse hypointense T2 disc signal noted. There is a small broad-based central disc extrusion, extending inferiorly by approximately 4 mm. Subtle T2 hyperintensity within it likely represents an annular fissure. It abuts but does not significantly compress either descending S1 nerve root. Subtle hypointense T1/hyperintense T2 signal is noted within the ventral epidural space on the left side, just inferior to the disc. This is suspicious for a small fragment of extruded/sequestered disc. It abuts but does not displace the descending left S1 nerve root. No spinal stenosis. Minor narrowing of both neural foramina. Facet joints are unremarkable.     OPINION:  1. Small disc protrusions with annular fissures at L3-4 and L4-5 do not cause any nerve root impingement.     2. Small central disc extrusion at L5-S1 with suspected small extruded/sequestered disc fragment extending inferiorly on the left, adjacent to the descending left S1 nerve root. No significant displacement or compression of the nerve root is evident.     3. No spinal stenosis or significant neural foraminal narrowing at any level.",0

Query spinal stenosis or radiculopathy.     TECHNIQUE: Sagittal and axial T1 and T2 sequences of the lumbar spine.     COMPARISON: Lumbar spine x-rays February 8, 2021 (MIC).     FINDINGS: 5 lumbar type vertebrae are identified.  Mild chronic-appearing anterior height loss of T12 is observed.  Remaining vertebral body heights are normal.  Sagittal alignment of the lumbar spine is within normal limits.  Minor Modic type II signal alteration is seen throughout the imaged lower thoracic and lumbar spine anteriorly.  Type II Modic signal alteration is more extensive at L5-S1.  Marrow signal is otherwise unremarkable.  The conus medullaris terminates at the L2-3 level, within the lower limits of normal.

With this designation a normal conus medullaris is present at T12-L1.     There is normal alignment of the lumbar spine.  Slight decrease in generalized bone marrow signal with no focal bone lesion is likely hematopoietic in etiology.     At L4-5 there is a slight decrease in signal of the intervertebral disc, suggestive of a mild disc degeneration.  There is a focal central-left paracentral disc protrusion, with an associated 0.8 cm inferior extrusion of disc components.  In combination with mild facet joint arthropathy and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy this results in focal severe stenosis of the spinal canal and with narrowing of the left lateral recess.  Minimal narrowing of the right lateral recess.

Routine noncontrast study of the cervical spine has been performed and includes  sagittal T1 and T2-weighted imaging as well as axial gradient echo and turbo spin-echo  T2-weighted imaging.  Assessment includes from the base of the skull through the T4 level.  The craniocervical junction appears normal. Evaluation of C1-C2 and C2-C3 is normal.  At C3-C4, disc height is maintained. Tiny right-sided uncovertebral osteophytes are  present. Minor narrowing of the RIGHT foramen is seen as a result of uncovertebral  osteophytes and some minor hypertrophic facet change but definitive focal neurologic  compromise is unlikely. The central canal is widely patent at the level.  At C4-C5, disc height is relatively maintained. Tiny RIGHT uncovertebral osteophyte is  present. The foramina and central canal are widely patent without compromise.  At C5-C6, there is minor disc space narrowing with a mild concentric disc bulge which  shows some eccentricity on the left-hand side. There is a mild protrusion of the disc  which projects into the left-sided intervertebral foramen with resultant moderate to  marked narrowing of the LEFT foramen and irritation and/or compromise of the exiting  LEFT C6 root needs to be considered.

FINDINGS: The lumbar spine x-rays from December 05, 2019 demonstrate 5 lumbar  type vertebral bodies.  There is a normal lordotic curvature and alignment of the lumbar spine. Vertebral body  heights are well-maintained, with a tiny amount of bone marrow edema involving the  right L5-S1 endplates, consistent with fibrovascular endplate degenerative change.  The visualized portion of the retroperitoneum is within normal limits. The paraspinous  musculature is unremarkable. The conus medullaris is normal in appearance, and  terminates normally at approximately the L1 level.  The visualized portion of the lower thoracic spine and the upper lumbar spine  demonstrates normal discs, with no evidence of spinal canal/neural foraminal  narrowing.  L3-L4: Unremarkable.  L4-L5: There is mild degenerative disc disease, with mild loss of disc height, loss of  disc signal, and a mild diffuse disc bulge with a tiny superimposed left paracentral disc  protrusion and annular tear. Unremarkable facet joints. These findings result in  minimal narrowing of both lateral recesses, left greater than right, but no evidence of  compression or displacement of either L5 nerve root. No significant neural foraminal narrowing.  L5-S1: There is mild degenerative disc disease, with mild loss of disc height and subtle  loss of disc signal. There is a large right paracentral/foraminal disc extrusion, which  extends superior to the inferior endplate of L5 by 1 cm (sequence 2 image 5 the disc  extrusion measures approximately 2 cm transverse (sequence 5 image 19).  Unremarkable facet joints. The disc extrusion results in marked narrowing of the right  lateral recess, with inward displacement of the right S1 nerve root as well as mild  flattening of this nerve root, concerning for compression. There is also right inferior  neural foraminal narrowing, with the disc extrusion abutting the inferior aspect of the  exiting right L5 nerve root, also concerning for mild compression.  Right sacroiliac joint: No evidence of joint space widening, narrowing, or ankylosis. No  evidence of bone marrow edema, erosions, or fatty marrow change. No evidence of a  joint effusion or surrounding soft tissue edema.  Left sacroiliac joint: No evidence of joint space widening, narrowing, or ankylosis. No  evidence of bone marrow edema, erosions, or fatty marrow change. No evidence of a  joint effusion or surrounding soft tissue edema.  IMPRESSION:  1. Mild degenerative disc disease at the L5-S1 level, with a large right  paracentral/foraminal disc protrusion and a small amount of right-sided fibrovascular  endplate degenerative change. The disc extrusion results in inward displacement  and possible mild compression of the right S1 nerve root within the lateral recess.  There is also right inferior neural foraminal narrowing, with possible mild  compression of the exiting right L5 nerve root. These findings are likely causing the patient's right-sided back pain.  2. Mild degenerative disc disease at the L4-L5 level, but no evidence of compression of any nerve root at this level.  3. Unremarkable sacroiliac joints.  ",0

666,"FINDINGS:  Five lumbar-type vertebral bodies are identified. The vertebral body heights are  preserved throughout without evidence for compression fracture. The conus terminates  at the T12-L1 level and is of normal contour, caliber and signal. Visualized paraspinal  soft tissues are unremarkable to the extent visualized. There is an underlying  congenital stenosis of the lumbar spine extending from approximately the L2 vertebral  body through to L4 with shortened pedicular distances. Level by level information as  follows:  As visualized in the sagittal plane at T11-12 and T12-L1, there is mild degenerative disc  disease present at the disc levels, in particular at T12-L1 without evidence for spinal  canal or foraminal stenosis.  At L1-2, there is moderate degenerative disc disease with narrowing of the  intervertebral disc space and diffuse loss of intranuclear T2 signal with circumferential  disc bulge, which indents the ventral thecal sac resulting in mild-to-moderate spinal  canal stenosis and crowding of the cauda equina nerve roots. Disc and osteophyte  extending into the foramina, left greater than right, without visible impingement or  compression on the exiting L2 nerves. Facet joints exhibit minor degenerative  changes.  At L2-3, moderate severe degenerative disc disease with areas of vacuum  phenomenon seen anteriorly and endplate remodeling. Circumferential disc bulge with  background congenital stenosis result in moderate severe spinal canal stenosis and  significant crowding of the cauda equina nerve roots such that there is no visible surrounding CSF. There is prominent epidural fat at this level. Disc and endplate  osteophytes extend in the foramina, right greater than left. There is possible contact by  disc and endplate osteophyte along the foraminal portion of the right L3 nerve (axial  image 14), which has the potential for contact and irritation. No evidence for left  foraminal stenosis. The facet joints are relatively well maintained apart from minor  early degenerative change.  At L3-4, moderate severe degenerative disc disease with diffuse circumferential disc  bulge and underlying congenital stenosis of the lumbar spine. Moderate severe spinal  canal stenosis with significant crowding of the cauda equina nerve roots and prominent  epidural fat. There is a superimposed small central disc protrusion. Disc and endplate  osteophyte extend into the foramina, but the perineural fat surrounding the foraminal  portions of the L3 nerves is relatively well maintained. There is minor degenerative  change of the facet joints and minor ligamentum flavum hypertrophy but not  significantly contributing to spinal canal stenosis.  At L4-5, severe degenerative disc disease with mixed type I and type II Modic endplate  changes. There is moderate severe spinal canal stenosis at this level with  circumferential disc bulge and significant crowding of the cauda equina nerve roots and  prominent epidural fat at this level. There is severe left foraminal stenosis with  compression and impingement of the foraminal left L4 nerve. There is moderate right  foraminal stenosis with potential contact and irritation on the foraminal portion of the  right L4 nerve. There is moderate right and mild left facet arthropathy with ligamentum  flavum hypertrophy with facet joint tropism, which does not result in significant spinal  canal stenosis.  At L5-S1, signal from the intervertebral disc is relatively well maintained. There is no  evidence for significant spinal canal or foraminal stenosis. Mild left facet arthropathy is  present.  IMPRESSION:  MRI LUMBAR SPINE  Extensive multilevel degenerative disc disease with background congenital  stenosis of the lumbar spine with shortened pedicular distance and multiple  degenerated discs extending from L1-2 through to L4-5 with disc bulges as well  as spinal canal and foraminal stenosis resulting in a variation of moderate to  severe spinal canal stenosis secondary to disc bulges and underlying congenital  stenosis in combination, as described. As expected, severe multilevel lateral  recess stenosis and multilevel foraminal stenosis, which is severe at L4-5 on the  left and moderate on the right with suspected impingement of the exiting L4  nerves, left greater than right.  Thank you for involving us in the care of . Based on the imaging findings  observed on today's MRI, he may benefit from a nerve root/epidural injection  particularly since he is describing symptoms of radiculopathy. These can be  helpful for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. In this particular case, as  noted, there is multilevel spinal canal and foraminal stenosis; ultimately, the  patient would benefit from a surgical opinion. Given his left-sided leg symptoms,  a targeted left L4 and/or left L5 nerve root injection may be helpful or alternatively  a caudal epidural injection.

680,"FINDINGS:  There is straightening of the normal cervical lordosis which may be positional, or  secondary to underlying mild degenerative change. There is a mild convex right  curvature of the cervical spine present. The posterior fossa structures are  unremarkable. There is no evidence for Chiari malformation. The vertebral artery flow  voids are maintained bilaterally. Cervical spinal cord is of normal contour, caliber and  signal. There is no abnormal signal hyperintensity or evidence of syrinx demonstrated.  The prevertebral and paravertebral soft tissues to the extent visualized are  unremarkable. Level by level information as follows:  The atlantooccipital articulations are normally aligned. The atlantodental interval is  maintained. The lateral mass articulation alignment at C1-C2 is preserved.  At C2-3, mild degenerative disc disease with loss of intranuclear T2 signal without  evidence for spinal canal or foraminal stenosis. The facet joints are well-maintained  bilaterally.  At C3-4, mild degenerative disc disease with diffuse loss of intranuclear T2 signal with  tiny anterior endplate osteophyte with very shallow left central disc protrusion,  unchanged from prior without evidence for spinal canal or foraminal stenosis. Facet  joints are well-maintained.  At C4-5, mild degenerative disc disease with loss of intranuclear T2 signal, but no  evidence for spinal canal or foraminal stenosis. Facet joints are relatively well maintained bilaterally.  At C5-C6, tiny central disc protrusion minimally more prominent compared to the  previous examination which indents the ventral thecal sac without evidence for  significant spinal canal or foraminal stenosis. The ventral spinal cord minimally flattens  at this level. Facet joints are well-maintained bilaterally.  At C6-7, minor degenerative disc disease with minor loss of intranuclear T2 signal  without evidence for spinal canal or foraminal stenosis. Facet joints are wellmaintained.  At C7-T1, signal from intervertebral disc is well-maintained without evidence for spinal  canal or foraminal stenosis. Facet joints are unremarkable.  As visualized in the sagittal plane, T1-2, T2-3 and T3-4, signal from intervertebral discs  is well maintained without evidence for spinal canal or foraminal stenosis.  IMPRESSION:  MRI of the cervical spine demonstrates mild degenerative disc disease, the  overall appearances of which are relatively similar to the examination performed  November 30, 2018. However, there is a tiny central disc protrusion/disc  osteophyte complex at C5-6 is minimally more prominent compared to prior  which is associated with very subtle ventral spinal cord flattening.

712,"PROCEDURE NAME(S):    MR L-SPINE NO CONTRAST    HISTORY:   MVC MARCH/19. ONGOING LOW BACK PAIN, RADICULAR PAIN R S1 NERVE ROOT PATTERN                             No prior studies for comparison.          TECHNIQUE:    Routine institutional lumbar spine protocol.          FINDINGS:    There is normal vertebral alignment. There are 5 lumbar-type vertebra. Vertebral body heights are maintained. No suspicious bone   marrow signal abnormality.       At L4/5, there is circumferential disc bulge causing bilateral lateral recess stenosis (L>R) which touches the descending left L5  nerve root in the lateral recess without definite compression. There is no significant central canal stenosis. No significant   neural foraminal stenosis.       There is no significant discopathy, central canal or neural foraminal stenosis at the remaining lumbosacral levels.       There is moderate bilateral L5/S1 facet joint degeneration and mild bilateral L4/5 facet joint degeneration.       Unremarkable appearances of the imaged distal spinal cord/conus medullaris.          CONCLUSION:    Bilateral lateral recess stenosis at L4/5 touching the descending left L5 nerve root without definite compression.        No significant central canal or neural foraminal stenosis throughout the lumbosacral spine.       Moderate bilateral L5/S1 and mild bilateral L4/5 facet joint degeneration.     ",0
733,"Technique:   Sagittal T1, sagittal T2, axial T2 and axial T2 medic imaging of the cervical spine was performed. Sagittal T1 and sagittal T2-weighted imaging of the thoracic spine was also performed.      FINDINGS:      MRI CERVICAL SPINE:   There is normal alignment of the vertebral bodies and facet joints with no significant loss in vertebral body height. Endplate degenerative changes are most prominent at C5/6.      C2/3: No significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing.      C3/4: Small broad-based disc osteophyte complex is noted with buckling of the ligamentum flavum contributing to mild spinal canal narrowing. Minor left neural foraminal narrowing is noted.      C4/5: Broad-based disc osteophyte complex is noted with buckling of the ligamentum flavum resulting in mild to moderate spinal canal narrowing. No significant neural foraminal narrowing.      C5/6: Broad-based disc osteophyte complex is noted with buckling of the ligamentum flavum resulting in moderate to severe spinal canal narrowing. Moderate right and moderate to severe left neural foraminal narrowing is also noted.      C6/7: Small broad-based disc osteophyte complex is noted with no significant spinal canal narrowing. Mild left neural foraminal narrowing is demonstrated.      C7/T1: No significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing.      No definite abnormal T2 hyperintense signal is demonstrated within the cervical spinal cord. Patchy nonspecific T2 hyperintensities within the visualized pons may relate to microangiopathic change.      MRI THORACIC SPINE:   Minor anterior wedging of the T1, T2, and T3 vertebral bodies may relate to previous trauma. Small Schmorl's nodes are noted within the lower half of the thoracic spine.

For the purposes of this report (as well as to remain consistent with the prior radiograph reports), the inferiormost fully-formed disc will be labeled the L5/S1 level. Note is made of an underdeveloped disc at the S1/2 level as well as an anterolisthesis of the body of L3 with respect to the body of L4. A mild curvature is present convex to the left. The vertebral body heights are well-maintained and appear unchanged in the interval. The bone marrow signal is fairly homogeneous allowing for degenerative endplate changes at several levels, most notably at the L4/5 level and at the L3/4 level. The conus medullaris terminates normally at approximately the level of the T12/L1 intervertebral disc. The a small incidental perineural cyst is noted within the sacral spinal canal at the S2 level.   Â   At the S1/2 level, an underdeveloped disc is noted.

Degenerative endplate changes are present, more prominent eccentric to the left. Narrowing of the intervertebral disc is present, advanced on the left and mild to moderate on the right. A small amount of vacuum phenomenon is present within the intervertebral disc eccentric to the left. Disc/osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline which extends laterally protruding into the inferior aspect of the neural foramen bilaterally, more prominent on the left side. The posterior disc/osteophyte complex does not appear to involve the traversing L5 nerve roots. Degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints, moderate on the left and mild on the right. There is borderline hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum. The findings are resulting in moderate compromise of the left neural foramen and minimal/mild compromise of the right neural foramen. No   significant compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.  Â   At the L3/4 level, moderate-to-advanced degenerative endplate changes are present along with marked narrowing of the intervertebral disc.

THERE IS MILD MASS EFFECT ON THE RIGHT ANTERIOR CORD AT  C5-6 AND C6-7 SECONDARY TO THE RIGHT POSTERIOR DISC AND OSTEOPHYTE COMPLEXES WITH NO EVIDENCE OF CORD EDEMA OR SYRINX.  FORAMINAL   NARROWING IS PRESENT AS DESCRIBED MOST PROMINENT ON THE RIGHT FROM C3-4 TO C5-6.  OVERALL THE FINDINGS HAVE MILDLY PROGRESSED   COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS STUDY.  NO NEW ABNORMALITY.",0
943,"MRI OF THE CERVICAL SPINE      Technical:   T1 and T2 sagittal   Axial MEDIC      FINDINGS   There is loss of the normal cervical lordosis with a kyphosis centered at the C5-6 level.      The craniocervical junction appears normal.      At C2-3 the disc, foramina, and central spinal canal appear normal.      At C3-4 the disc, foramina, and central spinal canal appear unremarkable.      At C4-5 disc, foramina, and central spinal canal appear unremarkable.      At C5-6 there are bilateral uncovertebral degenerative changes with narrowing of the foramina bilaterally.  There is no central spinal stenosis despite a lobulated posterior disc osteophyte complex at this level.      At C6-7 there is a minimal broad-based disc osteophyte complex centrally and to the right of midline which indents upon the thecal sac.  Thin rim of CSF continues to surround the spinal cord, and cord compression is felt not to be present.  There are uncovertebral degenerative changes at this level with resultant minimal narrowing of the medial aspect of the right-sided foramina.      At C7-T1 the disc, foramina, and central spinal canal appear unremarkable..      OPINION   Multilevel degenerative changes at the C5-6 and C6-7 level.  This is most marked at the C5-C6 C6-7 foraminal level of the right.",0

FOR SPONDYLOARTHROPATHY PROTOCOL OF ENTIRE SPINE.  IS THIS ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS?   AND WORSENING RADATION TO THE LEFT LEG.     Spondyloarthropathy protocol.     Vertebral body heights are maintained.  Increased thoracic kyphosis and lumbar lordosis.  Minor anterolisthesis L3 vertebral body on L4, L4 vertebral body on L5.  Degrees of degenerative signal loss, narrowing, marginal osteophytosis, and/or Modic endplate signal alteration/shallow Schmorl type herniation involving multiple cervical, thoracic, lumbar intervertebral discs.  Disc osteophyte complexes indent the ventral thecal sac 3-7 without cord compression.  Small thoracic disc osteophyte complexes at multiple levels also indents the ventral thecal sac without frank canal stenosis or cord compression.  Degrees of degenerative facet joint overgrowth particularly at lumbar levels.  No focal abnormal inflammatory signal alteration is seen to suggest active spondylitis.     The sacroiliac joints are patent showing degenerative cartilage thinning, subchondral sclerosis, marginal osteophytosis; with small patchy areas of reactive subchondral marrow edema at the anterior margins of both joints.     There is marginal change overall compared with the prior study of July 30, 2018.     Opinion:     Marginal if any alteration overall compared with the prior study.  Widespread degenerative changes again present, with small scattered areas of subchondral STIR signal increase in both sacroiliac joints anteriorly felt most likely to be degenerative in nature.  The features do not convincingly suggest active inflammatory spondylitis or sacroiliitis.",0
963,"Reason for Exam: CHRONIC NON RESOLVING RT S1 SCIATICA  QUERY RT S1 N ROOT COMPRESSION     TECHNIQUE:     Routine lumbar spine protocol.     FINDINGS:     Conus terminates normally with tip located at L1.  Alignment and vertebral body heights are normal.     At L4/5, there is disc desiccation, mild disc narrowing and bulky central/right paracentral disc protrusion which results in moderate effacement of thecal sac and narrowing of both lateral recesses.  The latter is greater on the right and associated with compression of right traversing L5 nerve root.  Neural foramina are patent.  Mild facet OA is noted.     At L5/S1, there is mild facet OA, greater on the right.  Canal, lateral recesses and neural foramina are patent.     Epidural lipomatosis is noted at L4/5 and L5/S1 levels.     IMPRESSION:     Bulky disc protrusion at L4/5 which along with epidural lipomatosis results in moderate effacement of thecal sac.  There is stenosis of right lateral recess at this level and impingement of right traversing L5 nerve root.",1
967,"CT LUMBAR SPINE       Imaging obtained from T12 through S1. 3-D reconstructions were produced.       This is a complex exam.       The patient has a history of multiple remote lumbar fractures.       The L3 vertebral body is displaced to the left and is shifted considerably inferiorly lies at the level of the L4 and 5 vertebral  bodies. The cephalad margin of the L4 vertebral body is seen at the level of the inferior margin of L2. There is also a rotational  between superior and inferior vertebral columns. There is severe degenerative disc disease at L1-2 with some vacuum phenomenon.   Between the right margin of the upper vertebral column at the left margin of the inferior column, there is some vacuum phenomenon   and this may related to a pseudoarticulation. There is also a kyphotic deformity between the 2 columns with approximately 35   degrees apex posterior.       There is considerable degenerative change and distortion about the facet joints in the mid lower lumbar levels. Vacuum phenomenon  is seen at multiple levels.       The neural foramina at all 1-2 and L2-3 appear grossly patent. At L4-5 I suspect there is severe left neural foraminal narrowing   related to facet deformity and disc bulge. At L5/S1 there also appears to be moderately severe left neural foraminal narrowing   related to what is likely a disc bulge.       IMPRESSION:       Complex exam with significant deformity as described above.",0
987,"COMPARISON: Previous x-ray March 19/19 (LCH).      TECHNIQUE: Routine non-augmented L-spine radiculopathy protocol.      FINDINGS:   5 lumbar type vertebral bodies are identified, as on prior plain radiograph. Conus medullaris is therefore noted to terminate normally at L1. Alignment of the lumbar spine is satisfactory.      L3-4 demonstrates mild degenerative facet joint change on the right but is otherwise unremarkable. No stenosis seen.      L4-5 demonstrates moderate degenerative facet joint change bilaterally. No significant stenosis is seen.      L5-S1 demonstrates loss of disc height. Broad-based left paracentral disc protrusion is seen. Mild right and moderate left degenerative facet joint changes also noted. Moderate left lateral recess stenosis results, possibly affecting the traversing left S1 nerve root. Disc protrusion partially extends into the inferior aspect of the left neural foramen, and contacts the exiting left L5 nerve root as well. However, there remains ample epidural fat surrounding the exiting left L5 nerve root. No significant right-sided stenosis seen at this level.      IMPRESSION: Left paracentral disc protrusion at L5-S1, possibly affecting the traversing left S1 nerve root.",0

Correlation is made with radiographs dated March 12, 2020.       TECHNIQUE:    Routine institutional lumbar spine protocol.       FINDINGS:    5 lumbar-type vertebra. There are bilateral L5/S1 pars defects with grade 1 L5/S1 anterolisthesis and minor grade 1 L4/5   retrolisthesis. Vertebral alignment is otherwise maintained. Vertebral body heights are maintained. No suspicious bone marrow   signal abnormality.       At L2/3 and L3/4, there is discal dehydration and shallow noncompressive posterior disc bulges is no significant central canal or  neural foraminal stenosis. At L4/5, there is discal dehydration with no significant central canal and neural foraminal stenosis.       At L5/S1, there is grade 1 anterolisthesis with severe discal degeneration and loss of disc height but no significant posterior   disc bulge or central canal stenosis. There is bilateral neural foraminal stenosis secondary to the loss of disc height and   anterolisthesis, worse on the left.       No significant central canal or neural foraminal stenosis seen elsewhere within the lumbar and imaged lower thoracic spine. No   significant facet joint degeneration.       Unremarkable appearances of the distal imaged spinal cord/conus medullaris.          CONCLUSION:    Lytic grade 1 L5/S1 anterolisthesis with associated severe discal degeneration and loss of disc height contributing to bilateral   neural foraminal stenosis, worse on the left.       No significant central canal or neural foraminal stenosis elsewhere throughout the lumbar spine.     ",1
