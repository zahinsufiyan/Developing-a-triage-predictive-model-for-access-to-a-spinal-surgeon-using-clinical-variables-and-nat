URGENT     COMPARISON: Previous x-ray May 2/17 (Hardisty Heatlh Centre).     TECHNIQUE: Routine non-augmented L-spine radiculopathy protocol.     FINDINGS:  5 lumbar type vertebral bodies are identified, as on prior plain radiograph. Conus medullaris is therefore noted to terminate normally at L1. There is limited visualization of the thoracolumbar junction. However, very minimal anterior wedging is seen. Schmorl's nodes are noted involving the superior and inferior endplates of T12, as well as the superior endplate of L1. This may relate to congenital Scheuermann's disease.     T11-12 demonstrates loss of disc height. Minimal posterior disc osteophyte complex is seen, along with mild degenerative facet joint change bilaterally. No stiffness stenosis results at this level.     T12-L1 demonstrates mild degenerative facet joint change bilaterally. No significant stenosis seen.

T2 bright material is seen extending from the left paracentral annular tear inferior to the disc level. This extends into the right lateral recess measuring approximately 4 x 8 x 9 mm (AP x T x CC) in size. This is favored to represent sequelae of a sequestered disc fragment, and is compressing the traversing right L5 nerve root within the lateral recess. Mild degenerative facet joint changes are seen bilaterally. There is minimal stenosis of the left lateral recess also noted at this level. No other significant stenosis seen.     L5-S1 demonstrates a small central disc protrusion. In addition, there is a small 7 mm disc fragment seen to the right of midline just above this level.

Otherwise, to the extent visualized, the vertebral body heights are well - maintained. Mild degenerative change is present involving the predental space. Small anterior osteophytes are present extending from the C3 / 4 level superiorly down through the C6 / 7 level inferiorly. The cerebellar tonsils appear normal with respect to position. At the C2 / 3 level, the intervertebral disc is unremarkable. The neural foramina appear patent. At the C3 / 4 level, fairly prominent degenerative endplate changes are present. Degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints which results in an anterolisthesis of the body of C3 with respect to the body of C4 which measures approximately 5 to 6 mm with associated uncovering of the posterior aspect of the intervertebral disc. Disc / osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline which along with hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum results in mild compression of the adjacent thecal sac / spinal cord. Subtle focal abnormal increased T2 signal is present within the adjacent spinal cord compatible with edematous change. Degenerative change is present involving the uncovertebral joint bilaterally. The findings are resulting in fairly advanced neural foraminal tripartisan bilaterally. At the C4 / 5 level, degenerative endplate changes are present along with moderate narrowing of the intervertebral disc. Degenerative change is present involving the facet joints which results in an anterolisthesis of the body of C4 with respect to the body of C5 measuring approximately 3 mm with associated uncovering of the posterior aspect of the intervertebral disc. A tiny disc protrusion is present posteriorly, straddling the midline but slightly more prominent to the left of midline, which appears to abut but not significantly compress the ventral surface of the adjacent spinal cord. Degenerative changes are present involving the uncovertebral joint bilaterally. The findings are resulting in moderate compromise of the left neural foramen and mild compromise of the right neural foramen. At the C5 / 6 level, degenerative endplate changes are present along with moderate to advanced narrowing of the intervertebral disc. A small amount of vacuum phenomenon is suspected within the intervertebral disc. Degenerative change is present involving the facet joints which appears to result in a subtle retrolisthesis of the body of C5 with respect to the body of C6 which measures approximately 2 mm. Disc / osteophyte complex is present posteriorly, straddling the midline, which narrows the ventral subarachnoid space. Degenerative change is present involving the uncovertebral joint bilaterally, more prominent on the right side. Its findings are resulting in severe compromise of the right neural foramen and at least moderate compromise of the left neural foramen. At the C6 / 7 level, degenerative endplate changes are present along with moderate - to - advanced narrowing of the intervertebral disc. Mild disc / osteophyte complex exists present posteriorly straddling the midline, which narrows the ventral subarachnoid space. Degenerative changes are present involving the uncovertebral and facet joints bilaterally, more prominent putting the SAYLOR_singled side. The findings are resulting in moderate compromise of the Rod_Barajas_flied neural foramen and mild compromise of the left neural foramen. At the C7 / T1 level, subtle degenerative endplate changes are present. Mild degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints. The findings are resulting in minimal compromise of the left neural foramen. The right neural foramen is patent. The remainder of the visualized levels are unremarkable. To the insofar visualized, the shell_taco tissues of the neck are unremarkable.

807.0,"Findings:  Â   Direct comparison is made with the prior lumbar MRI of 2017.  Â   Identification of the L5 segment is defined by the location of the iliolumbar ligament.  Â   A normal conus medullaris terminates at L1 .  Â   Multilevel spondylosis and moderate-to-severe degenerative disc disease are again seen.  This has progressed in some levels.  Â   Degenerative bone marrow signal change is evident in multiple levels.  No other significant abnormality of bone marrow signal is seen.  Â   Central canal is reduced in two levels as discussed below.  Â   In T11-12, a chronic broad posterior disc-osteophyte complex results in mild central stenosis with some distortion of cord and thecal sac contour.  This may be the etiology of the thoracic myelopathy described on the history for the 2017 MRI request.  However, cord signal remains normal, showing no edema or evidence for myelomalacia.  The mild stenosis appears relatively stable.  Â   In T12-L1 and in L1-2, minor broad posterior disc bulges are stable, causing no neural compromise.  The facet joints show minor degenerative change without definite osteoarthritis.  Â   In L2-3, severe disc degeneration has nearly obliterated the intervertebral disc, representing a significant adverse change from 2017 when the disc was near normal.  There is minor retrolisthesis.  A broad posterior disc bulge associated with the disc degeneration is slightly eccentric towards the right side.  There is now mild central stenosis, with slight distortion in the thecal sac contour.  However, no convincing nerve root compromise is seen, as perineural fat is still preserved bilaterally with respect to exiting and descending nerves.  Mild/moderate osteoarthritis of the bilateral facet joints is present.  Â   Previously seen fluid between spinous processes of L2 and L3 has resolved, leaving advanced degenerative change.  Â   L3-4 remains stable.  A broad posterior disc bulge slightly indents the ventral thecal sac but does not cause any convincing neural compromise.  Previously suggested mild central stenosis shows no adverse change.  Moderately severe bilateral facet OA is evident.  Â   L4-5 is stable.  The broad posterior disc bulge indents the ventral thecal sac but does not cause convincing neural compromise.  The previously described mild bilateral foraminal stenosis shows no progression.  Perineural fat is still preserved.  Severe bilateral facet OA is again evident, with minimal degenerative grade 1 anterolisthesis which was previously present.  Â   L5-S1 is stable.  The minimal broad posterior disc bulge barely touches the thecal sac because of the capacious size of the central canal in this level.  Neural elements remain fully intact with no compromise.  Severe bilateral facet OA is again seen.  Â   Impression:  Â   Multilevel degenerative disc disease and spondylosis are again seen.  The only adverse change from 2017 is the development of new severe degenerative disc disease in L2-3 which was previously near normal.  Â   The above produces a new level of mild central stenosis.  Â   Prior mild central stenosis in T11-T12 remains stable; while there may still be mild cord compression, the cord does not show any edema or evidence of myelomalacia.  Clinical correlation is required regarding any persistence of the thoracic myelopathy clinically described in 2017.  Â   Again no other potential neural compromise is seen on this study, and there is no specific site of convincing nerve root compromise.  Â   Moderate to severe facet OA is present in most levels.",1

This appears secondary to bilateral L3 pars defects.     There is a couple of millimeters retrolisthesis of L4 on L5.  Otherwise the lumbar vertebral body heights and alignment are preserved.  Degenerative endplate changes are noted adjacent to L3-4 and L4-5. The conus tip is normal at L1.     At L2-3, the disc is normal.  There does however appear to be a cystic structure dorsal to the midline thecal sac which may be arising off one of the L2-3 facet joints.  Axial images did not quite extend through this lesion.  However it causes only minor indentation on the dorsal midline thecal sac.     At L3-4, there is uncovering of the disc and broad-based disc bulge with superimposed moderate-sized broad-based central disc extrusion with superior migration of disc material.

FINDINGS:  Comparison made to the MR lumbar spine from January 28, 2015 (Royal Alexandra Hospital) and lumbar spine x-rays from October 11, 2018 (Insight Medical Imaging).     Five lumbar vertebrae are assumed. Similar minimal curvature of the lumbar spine convex left. Vertebral body heights are maintained. Similar mild degenerative endplate changes noted ventrally at the L2-3 level, associated with small osteophytes. No marrow abnormalities of concern in the remainder of the spine.     Conus medullaris is normal, terminating at the L1 level.     No significant disc bulging or herniation noted at the T11-12, T12-L1 or L1-2 levels.     At L2-3, there is a small annular disc bulge indenting the thecal sac but not causing any nerve root impingement. Slight narrowing of both neural foramina but no impingement of the exiting L2 nerve roots. No spinal stenosis.     At L3-4, disc height is maintained. A small annular disc bulge is present, mildly indenting the thecal sac and slightly encroaching upon the inferior aspect of both neural foramina, but not causing any focal nerve root impingement. No significant facet degenerative changes. No spinal stenosis or lateral recess stenosis.     At L4-5, disc height is maintained. Mild annular disc bulging is present, resulting in slight encroachment upon the inferior aspect of both neural foramina but no impingement of the exiting L4 nerve roots. Mild bilateral facet degenerative changes. No spinal stenosis or lateral recess narrowing.     At L5-S1, there is slight loss of disc height with diffuse hypointense T2 disc signal indicative of disc degeneration. A small shallow central disc-osteophyte complex abuts the thecal sac. The small posterolateral disc extrusion situated paracentrally on the left, protruding inferiorly, demonstrated on the previous MR study, has almost completely resolved. A tiny residual/recurrent left posterolateral disc protrusion remains, indenting but not displacing the descending left S1 nerve root. The left S2 nerve root is no longer compressed. Similar mild stenosis of the left neural foramen. Right neural foramen remains of reasonable caliber. Similar mild degenerative changes of both facet joints. No spinal stenosis.     Visualized sacroiliac joints are unremarkable. Prevertebral soft tissues are unremarkable.     OPINION:  Previously demonstrated left-sided disc extrusion/sequestration at L5-S1 is no longer evident. A tiny left posterolateral disc protrusion remains at this level, indenting the descending left S1 nerve root within the lateral recess. No new superimposed abnormality. No spinal stenosis at any level.     _____________________________________________________________  Electronically Verified by Sandeep Naik on 11/12/2018 6:16 PM",0

No nerve root impingement is identified.     At the L1-2 level there is decreased T2 signal in the intervertebral disc indicating mild disc desiccation.  A tiny broad-based posterior disc bulge is present.  This does not cause any compromise to the spinal canal caliber or to the neural foramina.  Some minor degenerative change is present within the facet joints.     At the L2-3 level there is a small broad-based posterior disc bulge.  This causes some mild indentation on the anterior aspect of the thecal sac but no significant spinal stenosis.  There is some mild degenerative change within the facet joints.  No nerve root impingement is identified at this level.     At the L3-4 level there is severe loss of disc height.  There is uncovering of the posterior aspect of the intervertebral disc accompanied by a small broad-based posterior disc bulge.  There is hypertrophic degenerative change of moderate severity within both facet joints.

MRI THORACIC SPINE: Small benign hemangioma is noted within the ###kW_V8 vertebral body. Mild anterior wedging of the T8, T9, and T10 vertebral bodies is similar to the prior CT study of January 28, 2019. Multilevel endplate degenerative changes with undulation of the endplates within the mid / lower thoracic spine associated with small Schmorl ' s nodes are also again noted. An exaggeration of the thoracic kyphosis centered at T8 / 9 is also similar to the prior CT study. There is otherwise normal alignment of the vertebral bodies and facet joints. On the localizer images, prominent T2 hyperintensity within the L5 vertebral body may relate to an underlying hemangioma. Small superior Schmorl ' s nodes are also noted at L5 and S1. Focal ventral distortion of the thoracic spinal cord is siad at the serum_LDL_cholesterol of T8, abutting the T8 vertebral body. The posterior aspect of whenthe thoracic spinal cord at the level of T8 has a focally angulated appearance. Abnormal T2 hyperintensity is noted within the thoracic spinal cord at the level of T8 extending to the level of T9. Hypertrophic degenerative facet arthropathy isn_`_t contributing to mild neural foraminal narrowing at T11 / 12. No other significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing in the thoracic spine. 'S_GOT: Appearances are compatible with a spinal cord herniation at the level of T8. Abnormal T2 hyperintense signal within the thoracic spinal cord at T8 / 9 is compatible with cord edema / myelomalacia.

,"Findings: Â Direct comparison is made with the prior lumbar MRI of 2017. Â Identification of the L5 segment is defined by the location of the iliolumbar ligament. Â A normal conus medullaris terminates at L1. Â Multilevel spondylosis and moderate - to - severe degenerative disc disease are again seen. This has progressed in some levels. Â Degenerative bone marrow signal change is evident in multiple levels. No other significant Hashimoto_thyroiditis of bone marrow signal involves steady_incline. Â Central canal is reduced in two levels as discussed below. Â In T11 - 12, a chronic broad posterior disc - osteophyte complex results in mild central stenosis with some distortion of cord and thecal sac contour. This may be the etiology of the thoracic myelopathy described on the history for the 2017 MRI request. However, cord signal remains normal, showing no edema or evidence for myelomalacia. The mild stenosis appears relatively stable. Â In T12 - L1 and in L1 - 2, minor broad posterior disc bulges are stable, causing no neural compromise. The facet joints show minor degenerative change without definite osteoarthritis. Â Remarkably L2 - 3, severe disc degeneration has nearly obliterated the intervertebral disc, representing a significant adverse change from 2017 when the disc was near normal. There is minor retrolisthesis. A broad posterior disc bulge associated with the disc degeneration is slightly eccentric towards the right side. There is now mild central stenosis, with slight distortion in the thecal sac contour. However, no convincing nerve root compromise is seen, as perineural fat is still preserved bilaterally with respect to exiting and descending nerves. Mild / moderate osteoarthritis of the bilateral facet joints is present. Â Previously seen fluid between spinous processes of L2 and L3 has resolved, leaving advanced degenerative change. Â L3 - 4 remains stable. A broad posterior disc bulge considerably indents the ventral thecal sac but does not cause any convincing neural compromise. Previously suggested mild central stenosis shows no adverse change. Moderately severe bilateral facet OA is evident. Â L4 - 5 is stable. The broad posterior disc bulge indents the ventral thecal sac but does not cause convincing neural compromise. The previously described mild bilateral foraminal stenosis shows no progression. Perineural fat is still preserved. Severe bilateral facet OA is again evident, with minimal degenerative grade 1 anterolisthesis which was previously present. Â L5 - S1 is stable. The minimal broad posterior disc bulge barely touches the thecal sac because of the capacious size of the central canal in this level. Neural elements remain fully intact with no impass. Severe bilateral facet OA AI'm again seen. Â Impression: Â Multilevel degenerative disc disease and spondylosis are again seen. The only adverse change from 2017 is the development of new severe degenerative disc disease in L2 - 3 which was previously near normal.

795.0,TECHNIQUE: Routine lumbar spine protocol.  Â   FINDINGS:  5 lumbar type vertebra are assumed to be present.  Based on this the conus ends at the L1 vertebral level and is unremarkable.  Â   Sagittal imaging of L1-2: Intervertebral disc hydration is within normal limits.  No posterior disc protrusion.  Neuroforamina remain patent.  Â   Axial and sagittal imaging is performed from L2-3 through to L5-S1.  Â   L2-3: Mild disc dehydration.  Minor posterior generalized disc bulging.  Superimposed upon this there is a small posterior left parasagittal disc protrusion.  Small focus of increased signal is within the disc protrusion consistent with a tiny annular tear.  The protrusion is in close proximity to the descending left L3 nerve root.  No encroachment into the neural foramina.  The exiting L2 nerve roots do not appear compromised.  Â   L3-4: Minimal disc dehydration.  Minor posterior generalized disc bulging.  This results in some minor ventral indentation of thecal sac.

No spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis. Prominent anterior endplate osteophytes on the left side. L4 - 5 - Disc desiccation with mild loss of disc height and a small posterior annular tear. There is a small broad - based posterior disc bulge. There are severe bilateral facet joint degenerative changes. There is a 6 mm ovoid lesion at the medial aspect of the right L4 - 5 facet joint extending into the lateral recess, likely representing a synovial cyst, although there is no significant fluid signal. There are congenitally shortened pedicles. The combination of these findings is resulting in severe spinal stenosis with some effacement of the posterior epidural fat. There is mild buckling of the cauda equina proximal to this. There is severe bilateral lateral recess tricuspid_regurgitation with impingement on the descending L5 nerve roots bilaterally. There is mild right neural foraminal narrowing without exiting nerve root impingement. L5 - S1 - Normal disc. No spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis.

Comparison:   Note made of the CT chest, abdomen and pelvis study of 04/03/2016.     Findings:   There is minor S-shaped scoliosis, proximally convex to the right.  There is grade 1 anterolisthesis of L4 on L5.  There is   multilevel desiccation of the lumbar intervertebral discs with multiple Schmorl nodes, the largest involving the superior   endplate of T12.  Vertebral body heights are otherwise preserved and the bone marrow returns normal signal.       The lower thoracic cord and the cauda equina to the level of the L4 vertebral body are displaced anteriorly secondary to a   posterior long segment high T2 signal and low T1 signal lesion.  This is intradural and extramedullary and has maximal axial   dimensions of 15 mm x 12 mm (transverse x AP) and extends for a craniocaudal length of ~290 mm, from approximately the level of   the T11 vertebral body superiorly to the L4 vertebral body inferiorly.  Diffusion-weighted imaging was attempted but is markedly   degraded by motion artifact.  Nevertheless, the lesion does not demonstrate overt diffusion restriction.  Following gadolinium   administration, there is no lesional or abnormal parenchymal enhancement.     The lesion results in effacement of the CSF surrounding the distal imaged cord and there is anterior tethering of the cord from   approximately level of the T8 vertebral body.  The lesion also results in anterior and rightward displacement of the proximal   cauda equina.  The distal cauda equina is surrounded by CSF.  No associated perineural cysts are identified.  There is no   associated cord signal abnormality demonstrated.     On the sagittal T2 weighted counting study posterior disc osteophyte complexes are noted at C5-6 and C6-7 causing minor narrowing   of the AP dimensions of the canal without cord compression or altered cord signal.  There are multilevel thoracic spine   degenerative change with small posterior disc osteophyte complexes. One of these causes mild indentation of the theca at T3-4,   without significant narrowing of the spinal canal or associated cord signal abnormality.  There is circumferential bulge of the   L2-3, L3-4 and L4-5 intervertebral discs with some associated facetal degeneration and hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum at   these levels.   At L2-3 there is resultant narrowing of the subarticular zones bilaterally which, coupled with the presumed arachnoid cyst,   effaces the transiting L3 nerve roots.   The L3-4 disc similarly effaces the subarticular zones bilaterally and contacts but does not compress the exiting right L3 nerve   root within its far lateral recess.   The L4-5 disc narrows the subarticular zones bilaterally but does not compress transiting L5 nerve roots and does not contact the   exiting L4 nerves.   There is significant facetal hypertrophy at L5-S1 (R>L), narrowing the lateral dimensions of the spinal canal and contacting the   exiting right L5 nerve root without compression.     Multilevel mild neural foraminal narrowing is noted within the lumbar spine with moderate neural foraminal narrowing on the left   at L4/5.  Hypertrophic degenerative facet arthropathy is contributing to mild to moderate right neural foraminal narrowing at   T6/7 and mild to moderate left neural foraminal narrowing at T8/9.     There is partial fatty infiltration of the paraspinal musculature.     Opinion:   Multilevel lower cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine degenerative changes as described     Long segment intradural CSF signal lesion extending from the level of the T11 vertebral body to L4, compressing and anteriorly   displacing the distal spinal cord and cauda equina, without definite associated intrinsic altered cord signal.    Distortion/tethering of the thoracic spinal cord from the level of T8-T11 is suggestive of underlying adhesions. Features are   most in keeping with a spinal arachnoid cyst (Nabor type III spinal meningeal cyst).  Diffusion-weighted imaging was mildly   degraded by motion artifact but there was no definite diffusion restriction to suggest a spinal epidermoid cyst. No lesional   gadolinium enhancement.     Spine surgery referral is advised. Findings discussed with Sandy, Practice Manager (780 458 1234) at 15:00 on 26/08/2020 who will   kindly convey findings to referring clinician Dr McDonald.",0

Â Radiographs of the lumbar spine performed 17 August, 2020 and 13 June, 2016 are available for comparison. Â A clinical history of "" chronic back pain since motor vehicle accident in 1993 "" has been provided. Â TECHNICAL: Â Sagittal and axial T1 - and T2 - weighted sequences were performed. Â FINDINGS: Â Abyei_Referendum anatomy is present at the level of the lumbosacral junction. For the purposes of this report (as well as to remain consistent with the prior radiograph reports ), the inferiormost fully - formed disc will be labeled the L5 / S1 level. Note is made of an underdeveloped disc at the S1 / 2 level as well as Marco_Scutaro_bloop anterolisthesis of the body of L3 with respect to the body of L4. A mild curvature is present convex to the left. The vertebral body heights are well - maintained and appear unchanged in the interval. The bone marrow signal is fairly homogeneous allowing for degenerative endplate changes at several levels, most notably at the L4 / 5 level and at the L3 / 4 level. The conus medullaris terminates normally at approximately the level of the T12 / L1 intervertebral disc. The a small incidental perineural cyst is noted within the sacral spinal canal at the S2 level. Â At the S1 / 2 level, an underdeveloped disc is noted. No significant neural foraminal compromise or compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated. Â At the L5 / S1 level, the intervertebral disc is unremarkable. A pseudoarthrosis with associated degenerative change is present involving the transverse process of L5 with the sacrum on the left side. Mild degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints. No significant neural foraminal compromise or compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated. Â At the L4 / 5 level, a small anterior osteophyte is noted straddling the midline, more prominent to the left of midline. Degenerative endplate changes are present, more prominent eccentric to the left. Narrowing of the intervertebral disc is present, advanced on the left and mild to moderate for the right. A small amount of vacuum phenomenon is present within the intervertebral disc eccentric to the left. Disc / osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline which extends laterally protruding into the inferior aspect of the neural foramen bilaterally, more prominent on the left side. The posterior disc / osteophyte complex does not appear to involve the traversing L5 nerve roots. Degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints, moderate on the left and mild on the right. There is borderline hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum. Each findings are resulting in moderate compromise of the left neural foramen and minimal / mild compromise of the right neural foramen. No significant compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated. Â At the L3 / 4 level, moderate - to - advanced degenerative endplate changes are present along with marked narrowing of the intervertebral disc. Vacuum phenomenon is present within the intervertebral disc. A defect is present within the pars interarticularis bilaterally at the L3 level with an associated anterolisthesis of the body of L3 with respect to the body of L4 measuring approximately 8 mm resulting in uncovering of the posterior aspect of the intervertebral disc. Disc / osteophyte complex is present laterally protruding into the region of the neural foramen bilaterally. Mild degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints. The findings are resulting in severe compromise of the right neural foramen and moderate - to - severe compromise of the left neural foramen. No significant compromise of AEGIS_LTD adjacent thecal sac is appreciated. â_€_œGood The remainder of the visualized levels is unremarkable allowing for minor degenerative disc and facet joint changes. Â Atheromatous irregularity is present involving the abdominal aorta extending into the intra_articular arteries bilaterally. To the extent visualized, regional soft tissue structures are otherwise unremarkable. Â IMPRESSION: Â Transitional anatomy is present at the level of the lumbosacral junction, as stated above. Radiographic correlation is recommended in an effort to ensure accurate localization, especially prior to any interventional procedure. Â Degenerative change is present involving the intervertebral disc and the nuance joints at multiple levels resulting in neural foraminal compromise at several levels, most striking bilaterally at the L3 / 4 level as well as on presumably left side at the L4 / 5 level, as detailed above. Bilateral spondylolysis is present at the L3 level resulting in a grade 2 anterolisthesis of the body of L3 with respect to the body of L4 and associated bilateral neural foraminal compromise, as discussed. The degree of anterolisthesis at the L3 / 4 level appears relatively unchanged when compared with the radiographs performed 17 August, 2020. Â",1

There is mild degenerative endplate signal changes, but no suspicious marrow replacing lesions are seen. Mild left convex curvature of the upper lumbar spine. Â At T11 - 12: Small left paracentral disc protrusion mildly narrowing the left lateral / subarticular recess. No evidence of significant impingement upon the conus medullaris. Mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing secondary to facet arthropathy. Â At T12 - L1: No significant spinal canal narrowing. Mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing secondary to facet arthropathy. Â At L1 - 2: Small broad disc bulge. No evidence of nerve root impingement. Cloudier bilateral neural foraminal narrowing secondary to facet arthropathy. Â At L2 - 3: Broad disc bulge in combination with ligamentum flavum thickening and hypertrophic facet arthropathy causes mild to moderate narrowing of the spinal canal, most conspicuously time subarticular recesses where disc abuts the traversing L3 nerve roots. This is similar as in 2016. Severe right and moderate left neural foraminal narrowing secondary to facet arthropathy and foraminal disc on the right is also unchanged. Â At L3 - 4: Broad disc bulge in combination with hypertrophic facet arthropathy mild to moderately narrows the spinal canal, similar to previous. Moderate bilateral neural foraminal narrowing secondary to facet arthropathy has increased from third. Â At L4 - 5: Grade 1 anterolisthesis of L4 and L5 associated facet arthropathy is increased from 2016. This is associated with mild unroofing of the disc, but no significant posterior disc bulge. Hypertrophic facet is most prominent on the left where there is marked narrowing of the subarticular recess, vulnerable causing some distortion of the traversing L5 nerve root. Moderate left and mild right neural foraminal narrowing secondary to facet arthropathy and small amount of foraminal disc. This has increased from 2016.

Disc and osteophyte  extending into the foramina, left greater than right, without visible impingement or  compression on the exiting L2 nerves. Facet joints exhibit minor degenerative  changes.  At L2-3, moderate severe degenerative disc disease with areas of vacuum  phenomenon seen anteriorly and endplate remodeling. Circumferential disc bulge with  background congenital stenosis result in moderate severe spinal canal stenosis and  significant crowding of the cauda equina nerve roots such that there is no visible surrounding CSF. There is prominent epidural fat at this level. Disc and endplate  osteophytes extend in the foramina, right greater than left. There is possible contact by  disc and endplate osteophyte along the foraminal portion of the right L3 nerve (axial  image 14), which has the potential for contact and irritation. No evidence for left  foraminal stenosis. The facet joints are relatively well maintained apart from minor  early degenerative change.  At L3-4, moderate severe degenerative disc disease with diffuse circumferential disc  bulge and underlying congenital stenosis of the lumbar spine. Moderate severe spinal  canal stenosis with significant crowding of the cauda equina nerve roots and prominent  epidural fat. There is a superimposed small central disc protrusion. Disc and endplate  osteophyte extend into the foramina, but the perineural fat surrounding the foraminal  portions of the L3 nerves is relatively well maintained. There is minor degenerative  change of the facet joints and minor ligamentum flavum hypertrophy but not  significantly contributing to spinal canal stenosis.  At L4-5, severe degenerative disc disease with mixed type I and type II Modic endplate  changes. There is moderate severe spinal canal stenosis at this level with  circumferential disc bulge and significant crowding of the cauda equina nerve roots and  prominent epidural fat at this level. There is severe left foraminal stenosis with  compression and impingement of the foraminal left L4 nerve. There is moderate right  foraminal stenosis with potential contact and irritation on the foraminal portion of the  right L4 nerve. There is moderate right and mild left facet arthropathy with ligamentum  flavum hypertrophy with facet joint tropism, which does not result in significant spinal  canal stenosis.  At L5-S1, signal from the intervertebral disc is relatively well maintained. There is no  evidence for significant spinal canal or foraminal stenosis. Mild left facet arthropathy is  present.  IMPRESSION:  MRI LUMBAR SPINE  Extensive multilevel degenerative disc disease with background congenital  stenosis of the lumbar spine with shortened pedicular distance and multiple  degenerated discs extending from L1-2 through to L4-5 with disc bulges as well  as spinal canal and foraminal stenosis resulting in a variation of moderate to  severe spinal canal stenosis secondary to disc bulges and underlying congenital  stenosis in combination, as described. As expected, severe multilevel lateral  recess stenosis and multilevel foraminal stenosis, which is severe at L4-5 on the  left and moderate on the right with suspected impingement of the exiting L4  nerves, left greater than right.  Thank you for involving us in the care of . Based on the imaging findings  observed on today's MRI, he may benefit from a nerve root/epidural injection  particularly since he is describing symptoms of radiculopathy. These can be  helpful for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. In this particular case, as  noted, there is multilevel spinal canal and foraminal stenosis; ultimately, the  patient would benefit from a surgical opinion. Given his left-sided leg symptoms,  a targeted left L4 and/or left L5 nerve root injection may be helpful or alternatively  a caudal epidural injection.

There are both focal and heterogenous areas of T1 and T2 hypointensity distributed  throughout the visualized bone marrow largest areas are seen in the right sacroiliac  and left ilium on the axial images and measuring up to 3.7 cm. These areas are  avidly T1 hypointense, more hypointense than the vertebral disc. There is no  associated fracture identified.  The appearances raise possibility of an underlying marrow infiltrative process.  Limited assessment of the retroperitoneal structures demonstrates no significant  abnormality.

There is  mild bilateral neuroforaminal stenosis.  L3-4: Moderate generalized disc bulge with a focal right paracentral neuroforaminal  component. The combination causes severe right-sided neuroforaminal stenosis.  There is mild narrowing of the lateral recess. Moderate left neuroforaminal stenosis  and moderate facet arthropathy is present. L4-5: There is a right paracentral and neural foraminal disc protrusion. This causes  severe right neuroforaminal stenosis.

There is no evidence for Chiari malformation demonstrated. The vertebral artery flow voids are maintained bilaterally. The left vertebral artery is dominant. There is straightening and mild reversal of the cervical lordosis present. The straightening extends from the C1 vertebral body/skull base through to the C6 vertebral body level. Prevertebral and paravertebral soft tissues to the extent visualized are unremarkable. No bulky adenopathy is seen within the neck. Level by level information as follows:     The atlanto-occipital articulations are normally aligned. The atlantodental interval exhibits mild degenerative change. The lateral mass articulation alignment at C1-C2 is preserved. There is evidence of mild degenerative disc disease at C2-3 with loss of disc signal and a tiny central disc protrusion. No significant spinal canal or foraminal stenosis is demonstrated. The facet joints are well maintained.     At C3-4, there is a mild disc bulge with superimposed disc protrusion, similar to the previous examination. This indents the ventral thecal sac resulting in mild contour change of the ventral spinal cord, not significantly changed compared to the previous examination without cord signal change. No foraminal stenosis. Facet joints are unremarkable.     At C4-5, there is degenerative disc disease with loss of intranuclear T2 signal and a tiny central disc protrusion without evidence for spinal canal or foraminal stenosis. The facet joints are unremarkable.     At C5-6, there is a moderate-to-severe degenerative disc disease with diffuse loss of intranuclear T2 signal and a 2 mm retrolisthesis with bilateral uncovertebral joint degenerative changes and mild cord signal change noted within the right lateral hemicord at this level involving the anterior horn gray matter. No abnormal enhancement is seen at this level. The spinal cord is flattened in configuration at this level given a underlying mild-to-moderate spinal canal stenosis.

FINDINGS: The lowest complete lumbar disc space is defined as L5 - S1 for the purposes of this report. There is a slight straightening of the natural lumbar lordosis potentially due to an element of muscle spasm. Lumbar vertebral height and alignment are otherwise preserved. No fractures. No spondylolisthesis. There qualifies degenerative disc disease at L4 - 5 as detailed below. The remaining lumbar discs are reasonably well preserved, although there are some prominent anterior endplate osteophytes at L3 - 4 and smaller endplate osteophytes at the other lumbar levels. The conus medullaris lies at L1. DISCS: T12 - L1 - Minor broad - based posterior disc bulge. No musculo_skeletal canal or neural foraminal stenosis. L1 - 2 - Normal disc. No spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis. L2 - 3 - Normal disc. No spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis. L3 - 4 - Normal disc. No spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis. Prominent anterior endplate osteophytes on the left side. L4 - 5 - Disc desiccation with mild loss of disc height and a small posterior annular tear. There is a small broad - based posterior disc bulge. There are severe ADMM_+ facet joint degenerative changes. Admittedly is a 6 mm ovoid lesion at fromthe medial aspect of the right L4 - 5 facet joint extending into the lateral recess, likely representing a synovial cyst, Frustratingly there is no significant fluid signal. There are congenitally shortened pedicles. The combination of these findings is resulting in severe spinal stenosis with some effacement of the posterior epidural fat. There is mild buckling of the cauda equina proximal to ASSISTANT_SECRETARY_BLAKE. There is severe bilateral lateral recess stenosis with impingement on the descending L5 nerve roots bilaterally. There is mild right neural foraminal narrowing without exiting nerve root impingement. L5 - S1 - Normal disc. No curved_spine canal or neural foraminal stenosis. Mild bilateral facet joint degenerative changes. Other: There is a large exophytic cyst arising from the lower pole of the left kidney, measuring approximately 7. 2 cm in diameter.

610.0,"TECHNIQUE: MRI of the lumbar spine was performed utilizing sagittal T1, T2, and STIR sequences through the entire lumbar spine, with axial T1 and T2 sequences through the lower 3 disc levels.     FINDINGS: Comparison is made to lumbar spine x-rays from October 07, 2019 and June 04, 2011.  These x-rays demonstrate 5 lumbar type vertebral bodies, as well as a cyst with a sclerotic margin along the posterior portion of the L4 vertebral body.     The MRI also demonstrates a cyst within the posterior aspect of the L4 vertebral body, along its left aspect.  This cyst measures 1.5 cm craniocaudad by 1 cm AP by 0.9 cm transverse, and appears stable when compared to the prior x-rays.  The MRI also demonstrates a low T1 and T2 signal intensity rim, consistent with the sclerosis on the x-rays.  This is associated with endplate irregularity along the superior aspect of the L4 vertebral body, which suggests that this is degenerative in etiology.  There is a small amount of fibrovascular endplate degenerative changes along the posterior left aspect of the L5-S1 level, preferentially involving the L5 endplate.  There is also evidence of extensive fatty endplate degenerative changes along the anterior aspect of the L4-L5 level.  Anterior osteophytes at multiple levels, preferentially at the L4-L5 level.     The visualized portion of the retroperitoneum is within normal limits.  The paraspinous musculature is unremarkable.  The conus medullaris is normal in appearance, and terminates normally at approximately the L1-L2 disc level.     The visualized portion of the lower thoracic spine and the upper lumbar spine demonstrate relatively normal discs, with no significant spinal canal/neural foraminal narrowing.     L3-L4: There is mild degenerative disc disease, with loss of normal disc signal, endplate irregularity, tiny anterior osteophytes, and subtle loss of disc height.  The cyst within the L4 vertebral body has been described previously.  There is also a tiny right foraminal disc protrusion that results in mild right inferior neural foraminal narrowing, but no evidence of compression of the exiting right L3 nerve root.  No significant spinal canal narrowing at this level.  No significant facet arthropathy.     L4-L5: There is moderate degenerative disc disease, with moderate loss of disc height, loss of disc signal, fatty endplate degenerative change, anterior osteophytes, and a mild diffuse disc bulge.  No significant facet arthropathy.  These findings result in minimal spinal canal narrowing, but no evidence of compression or displacement of the L5 nerve roots within the lateral recesses.  There is also evidence of mild bilateral inferior neural foraminal narrowing, but no evidence of compression of the exiting nerve roots.     L5-S1: There is mild to moderate degenerative disc disease, with preferential disc height loss along the left aspect of the disc level, where there is also a small amount of fibrovascular endplate degenerative change.  There is also loss of disc signal.  There is a mild disc bulge with a superimposed left paracentral disc protrusion.  No significant facet arthropathy or ligamentum flavum hypertrophy.  These findings result in left lateral recess narrowing with posterior displacement and mild flattening of the left S1 nerve root, concerning for compression.  Mild bilateral inferior neural foraminal narrowing, but no evidence of definitive compression of the exiting nerve roots.     IMPRESSION:     The L5-S1 level demonstrates mild to moderate degenerative disc disease, preferentially along the left aspect, where there is also left-sided fibrovascular endplate degenerative changes.  There is also a left paracentral disc protrusion at this level which results in posterior displacement and what appears to be mild compression of the left S1 nerve root within the lateral recess.  This could be a cause of the patient's left-sided symptoms.     2.          Moderate degenerative disc disease at the L4-L5 level, with associated fatty endplate degenerative changes and a mild diffuse disc bulge, but no significant spinal canal/neural foraminal narrowing.     3.          Mild degenerative disc disease at the L3-L4 level.  There are findings most suggestive of a degenerative endplate cyst arising off of the superior endplate of L4 and extending into the left/posterior aspect of the L4 vertebral body.  This is an unusual degenerative endplate finding, but the fact that the cyst was seen on the 2011 x-rays, and is grossly stable when compared to the prior x-rays, suggests that this is a benign finding.     The Workers' Compensation Board has requested that we provide a professional opinion as to whether the imaging findings are related whole or in part to the injury in question. This is not considered part of the official diagnostic imaging report, and will only be used to help a WCB caseworker decide whether the injury is work-related or not. My opinion is:  WCB Category - Some of the imaging findings could be related to the patient's injury.",0

467.0,"Technique: Sagittal and axial T1 and T2 sequences of the lumbar spine were provided.     Findings:     Compared to the CT scan of the lumbar spine dated February 26, 2016.     The lowest fully formed vertebral body is labeled L5, and the conus is therefore normally positioned at the L1 level. There is 4 mm of anterior subluxation of L5 upon S1, felt to be secondary to bilateral L5 pars defects. There is also straightening of the lumbar spine, loss of the normal lordosis. Alignment is otherwise unremarkable. Vertebral body marrow signal is unremarkable in appearance, other than a suspected hemangioma within the left aspect of L4.

588.0,"MRI Cervical Spine without Contrast  History: Degenerative disc disease with foraminal stenosis at C5-C6 on the LEFT and  bilateral C6 symptoms.  Routine noncontrast study of the cervical spine has been performed and includes  sagittal T1 and T2-weighted imaging as well as axial gradient echo and turbo spin-echo  T2-weighted imaging.  Assessment includes from the base of the skull through the T4 level.  The craniocervical junction appears normal. Evaluation of C1-C2 and C2-C3 is normal.  At C3-C4, disc height is maintained. Tiny right-sided uncovertebral osteophytes are  present. Minor narrowing of the RIGHT foramen is seen as a result of uncovertebral  osteophytes and some minor hypertrophic facet change but definitive focal neurologic  compromise is unlikely. The central canal is widely patent at the level.  At C4-C5, disc height is relatively maintained. Tiny RIGHT uncovertebral osteophyte is  present. The foramina and central canal are widely patent without compromise.  At C5-C6, there is minor disc space narrowing with a mild concentric disc bulge which  shows some eccentricity on the left-hand side. There is a mild protrusion of the disc  which projects into the left-sided intervertebral foramen with resultant moderate to  marked narrowing of the LEFT foramen and irritation and/or compromise of the exiting  LEFT C6 root needs to be considered.  At C6-C7, there is mild disc space narrowing with a concentric disc bulge and tiny  uncovertebral osteophytes. Intervertebral foramina and central canal the level appear  widely patent without compromise.  Assessment of C7-T1 through the T3-T4 level is normal.  The size and signal intensity of the cervical spinal cord is normal along its length.  Normal flow voids are documented bilaterally in the vertebral arteries along their length.  IMPRESSION:  Degenerative changes as are described above.  With regards to potential for producing neurologic symptoms, there is a concentric bulge  at C5-C6 which demonstrates eccentricity and mild protrusion on the left-hand side into  the intervertebral foramen. This is resulting in moderate to marked narrowing of the  foramen and irritation or compromise of the exiting LEFT C6 root needs to be  considered.",0

Degenerative endplate changes of mild to moderate severity at several levels, most notably L2-3.     There is a nonspecific spherical lesion situated posterolaterally within the L1 vertebral body on the left side. It measures 11 mm in diameter and demonstrates hypointense T1 and T2 signal. No bony expansion or cortical erosion. No corresponding abnormality in this region on the prior CT or recent x-rays.     Conus medullaris and visualized lower thoracic spinal cord are normal. Conus tip is situated at the L1-2 level. No fatty filum terminale.     Hypointense T2 signal noted within all of the discs, indicative of disc degeneration.     At T8-9, a small posterior disc-osteophyte complex paracentrally on the left compresses the thecal sac but does not cause any significant impingement of the spinal cord. No spinal stenosis or neural foraminal stenosis.     No significant abnormality at T9-10, T10-11 or T11-12.     At T12-L1, disc height is preserved. Minor posterior disc bulging. No nerve root impingement, spinal stenosis or neural foraminal stenosis. Incidental 5 mm perineural cyst within the right neural foramen, of doubtful significance.     At L1-2, disc height is maintained. There is a broad-based left posterolateral/foraminal disc protrusion narrowing the left lateral recess and the left neural foramen. Mild indentation upon the descending left L2 nerve root noted. No impingement of the exiting left L1 nerve root. No stenosis of the right lateral recess. Minor narrowing of the right neural foramen. No spinal stenosis. Minor facet degenerative changes.     At L2-3, there is mild loss of disc height. A small shallow posterior disc bulge does not affect the descending nerve roots. Mild facet degenerative changes. No spinal stenosis or lateral recess stenosis. Mild narrowing of both neural foramina.     At L3-4, disc height is preserved. A small broad-based disc bulge indents the thecal sac. Mild bilateral facet degenerative change and moderate ligamentum flavum thickening. Combination of these findings results in mild stenoses of both lateral recesses and both neural foramina. No significant spinal stenosis.     At L4-5, there is grade I spondylolisthesis of 5 mm secondary to severe bilateral facet degeneration and moderate ligamentum flavum thickening. Mild loss of disc height with a small shallow posterior disc bulge. Combination of these findings results in mild stenoses of both lateral recesses and mild spinal stenosis. There is a 7 mm T2 hyperintense cyst with thin hypointense rim situated laterally within the right lateral recess, anterior to the right facet joint. This is suspicious for a perineural or synovial cyst. It compresses the exiting right L4 nerve root proximally within the neural foramen. Mild to moderate stenosis of the left neural foramen.     At L5-S1, there is mild loss of disc height. Grade I spondylolisthesis of 5 mm, likely secondary to underlying facet degenerative change (worse on the right). A small posterior disc bulge abuts the descending S1 nerve roots. Neither root is displaced. Mild stenoses of both lateral recesses, slightly more so on the right. No significant spinal stenosis. There is severe stenosis of the right neural foramen, with effacement of the perineural fat and compression of the exiting right L5 nerve root. Moderate stenosis of the left neural foramen also noted, with slight flattening of the exiting left L5 nerve root.     Incidental 8 mm Tarlov cyst within the sacral spinal canal at the S2 level, of doubtful significance. Mild degenerative changes within the visualized sacroiliac joints. Mild symmetric posterior paraspinal muscle atrophy.     OPINION:  1. Grade I spondylolisthesis of L4 and L5 and L5 on S1 secondary to advanced facet degeneration at both levels. Severe stenosis of the right L5-S1 neural foramen with compression of the exiting right L5 nerve root.     2. Mild spinal stenosis and mild bilateral lateral recess stenoses at L4-5. A 7 mm synovial cyst or perineural cyst within the right L4-5 lateral recess encroaches upon the proximal right neural foramen, compressing the exiting right L4 nerve root.     3. Mild bilateral lateral recess narrowing and neural foraminal narrowing at L3-4.     4. Nonspecific T1/T2 hypointense lesion within the L1 vertebral body. A metastatic deposit is a possibility, given the history of breast cancer. A lipid poor intraosseous hemangioma is in the differential. A repeat bone scan/SPECT-CT is suggested for further assessment.",0

Right neural foramen is unremarkable.     L4-5: Intervertebral disc is dehydrated.  Minimal posterior disc bulging with only minor ventral indentation of thecal sac.     There is bilateral facet joint osteoarthritis with facet hypertrophy.  Joint effusions are present.  There is also ligamentum flavum thickening.  Arising from the right facet joint there is a small 3 mm synovial cyst.  The combination with mild bulging and the facet overgrowth and ligamentum flavum thickening and small right-sided synovial cyst results in impingement on the thecal sac with some mild narrowing of lateral recesses.  There is mild impingement of the descending right L5 nerve root.     L5-S1: Intervertebral disc is dehydrated with moderate loss of disc height.  Anterior vertebral osteophyte formation.  There is mild posterior generalized disc bulging.  This does not result in any compromise of the thecal sac but there is some mild encroachment into inferior aspects off the neural foramina bilaterally.  On the right side the exiting L5 nerve root appears to contact the disc and osteophyte margin.  On the left side there appears to be a thin fat plane maintained.     The vertebral body alignment is normal.  The vertebral body heights are maintained.  There is generalized mild to moderate fatty atrophy of the erector spinae musculature.     SUMMARY:     Multiple level degenerative disc disease as described.  Facet joint osteoarthritis at L4-5.     The most significant level appears to be at L4-5 where there is moderate narrowing of the canal diameter.  Mild impingement of the descending right L5 nerve root.  The right L5 nerve root also appears to contact the disc margin as it exits at the L5-S1 neural foramen.  This has potential for symptomatology.,0

Since the prior study, there is been progression of degenerative change at L3-4 now with increased Schmorl type herniation of the superior L4 endplate and mild overall loss of height.  Remaining lumbar vertebral body heights are maintained.  Anterolisthesis of the L3 vertebral body and L4 again evident, though increased during the interval now measuring about 9 mm.

TECHNICAL: Sagittal and axial T1 and T2 - weighted sequences stayed performed. FINDINGS: This report assumes five lumbar - type vertebrae. A curvature is present convex to the right which may in part be related to patient positioning. ##.The vertebral body heights are well maintained. The bone marrow signal is fairly homogeneous allowing for hemangiomata / fatty rests as well as degenerative endplate changes. The conus medullaris terminates normally at approximately the L1 level. At the S1 / 2 level, an underdeveloped disc is noted. No significant neural foraminal compromise or compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated. At the L5 / S1 level, at least moderate degenerative extensor changes are present along with moderate - to - advanced narrowing of the intervertebral disc. A small amount of vacuum phenomenon is suspected within the intervertebral disc. Mild disc / osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline, which extends laterally protruding into the inferior aspect of the neural foramen bilaterally. The posterior disc / osteophyte complex appears to abut but not significantly displace or compress the traversing S1 nerve root bilaterally. The disc herniation present posteriorly eccentric to the left on the prior study performed November 24, 2010 has resolved in the interval. Degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints, mild on the right and minimal on the left. No significant neural foraminal compromise or compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated. At the L4 / 5 Juarez_cartel_Mikeska, moderate degenerative endplate changes are present along with moderate narrowing of the intervertebral disc. Relatively minor disc / osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline, which extends laterally protruding into the inferior aspect of the neural foramen bilaterally. A superimposed moderate - sized disc protrusion / extrusion is present posteriorly straddling the midline but slightly more prominent to the right of midline and appears to abut and result mid posterior displacement and compression of the traversing L5 nerve root bilaterally, more prominent on the right side. Mild degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints. There is borderline hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum. The findings are resulting in moderate compromise of the adjacent thecal sac. No significant neural foraminal compromise is appreciated.

There does appear to be a more focal disc protrusion/extrusion in a right   paracentral location.  The posterior longitudinal ligament appears to be expanded and is widened in the AP dimension from the   level of the top of C6 2 the upper third of the C7 vertebral body posteriorly.  This produces a convexity which indents the   anterior aspect of the cervical cord at the C6-7 level.  There is tapering of the cord at this level as well as some altered   increased T2 signal identified within.       C7-T1: The intervertebral disc spaces maintained.  No central canal or neural foraminal compromise identified.       IMPRESSION: Slightly unusual appearance identified at C6-7 where there does appear to be a focal disc protrusion in a left   paracentral location.  I suspect that there is a small defect in the posterior longitudinal ligament allowing the focal herniation  to extend into/through the ligament with further extrusion in a superior and inferior direction at the posterior aspect of the   posterior longitudinal ligament this results in a posterior convexity indenting the cervical cord resulting in deformation of the   cord and some signal change within the substance of the cord in keeping with high-grade central canal stenosis.  Recommend urgent   neurosurgical opinion.    Alternatively, although much less likely, this could represent a focal disc as well as a intra-axial   lesion such as a meningioma.  An enhanced study may help in further clarification.       Asymmetric disc ossific bulges identified posterior A on the left at C4-5 C5-6 which results in mild narrowing of the left neural  foramina at these levels.",0

Minimal inferior foraminal narrowing.     At L2-3, there is broad-based disc bulge and mild facet degenerative change. Minor narrowing of the spinal canal is demonstrated as well as narrowing of the inferior left foramen.     At L3-4, there is broad-based disc bulge with superimposed left foraminal disc protrusion and extrusion with minor superior migration of disc material into the foramen. This causes some compression on the exiting left L3 nerve root. Minimal facet and ligamentous degenerative changes demonstrated. There is associated moderate to severe acquired spinal canal stenosis.     At L4 -5, there is broad-based disc bulge with superimposed moderate sized left paracentral disc extrusion with superior migration of disc material. This also demonstrates more hyperintense T2 signal which may represent sequestered disc fragment. There is associated narrowing of the left lateral recess and compression on the exiting left L4 nerve root.

294.0,"MRI LUMBAR SPINE  Technique:  Multiplanar multisequence MRI of the lumbosacral spine was performed.  FINDINGS:  The conus medullaris terminates at the L1-2. It is normal. The L1-2 disc space is  normal. The thecal sac, spinal canal and neural foramina are also normal at this level.  A mild degenerative disc bulge is seen at the L2-3 but the thecal sac, spinal canal and  neural foramina are normal.  At L3-4, a moderate degree generalized at degenerative disc bulge is seen. This is  associated with a mild to moderate degree reduction in the height of the disc space and  anterior marginal osteophyte formation. The thecal sac, spinal canal and neural  foramina are normal.  The L4-5 disc is normal. The thecal sac, spinal canal and neural foramina are normal.  There is a mild hypertrophic degenerative osteoarthritic is of bilateral facet joints at this  level.  At L5-S1, at least a moderate degree degenerative disc bulge is seen. Height of the  disc is space is slightly reduced and there is a posterior marginal osteophyte formation  on the left side which is causing narrowing of the inferior portion of the left L5-S1 neural  foramen. I suspect a mild compression of the left L5 nerve root outside the foramen  because of the marginal osteophyte. The right neural foramen and exiting right L5  nerve root are normal. Descending bilateral S1 nerve roots are normal in the lateral  recesses. Facet joints are normal.  OPINION: A moderate degree degenerative disc disease at L3-4 and L5-S1. The disc-osteophyte  formation is more pronounced in the left lateral aspect at the L5-S1 where the left L5  nerve root may be slightly impinged just outside the foramen, if any. Degenerative  osteoarthritis of the L4-5 facet joints is seen.  The Workers' Compensation Board has requested that we provide a professional  opinion as to whether the imaging findings are related whole or in part to the injury in  question. This is not considered part of the official diagnostic imaging report, and will  only be used to help a WCB caseworker decide whether the injury is work-related or  not. My opinion is:  Some of the imaging findings could be related to the patient's injury.",0

455.0,"TECHNIQUE: A routine lumbar spine protocol is performed.     FINDINGS:     The conus medullaris is appropriately situated at the T12-L1 level. No abnormality of signal or contour is identified within the distal cord or conus. Vertebral alignment is well maintained. Intervertebral disc spaces are well maintained. The intervertebral discs within the lower thoracic and upper lumbar spine as far distally as and including the L3-4 level, there is no disc bulge present. The spinal canal caliber is well maintained. Neural foramina are well maintained. There is no nerve root impingement. Facet joints are unremarkable.     At L4-5 level, there is mild decrease in T2 signal indicating early disc desiccation. There is a broad-based posterior disc protrusion which causes indentation upon the anterior aspect of the thecal sac. There is mild hypertrophy of ligamentum flavum at this level and these features produce mild spinal canal stenosis. In particular, there is some significant narrowing of the lateral recesses, more prominent on the left than on the right. This may cause some impingement upon the traversing L5 nerve roots. The disc bulge at this level produces some mild stenosis of the inferior aspects of the left neural foramen and some moderate stenosis of the right neural foramen in the absence of any nerve root impingement.     At the L5-S1 level, there is decreased T2 signal within the intervertebral disc indicating disc desiccation. There is a small broad-based posterior disc bulge which is slightly more prominent to the right of the midline. The disc bulge contains a tiny annular tear. The disc bulge does not cause any significant spinal stenosis. The neural foramina are mildly narrowed bilaterally in the absence of any direct nerve root impingement. There is some mild degenerative change within the facet joints.     CONCLUSION: There is disc degeneration at the L4-5 and L5-S1 levels. At the L4-5 level, disc bulge produces some narrowing of the spinal canal caliber and in particular, of the lateral recesses. There is potential for impingement upon the bilateral traversing L5 nerve roots. At the L5-S1 level, a small broad-based posterior disc bulge contains a tiny annular tear. There is mild degenerative change within the L5-S1 facet joints.     The Workers' Compensation Board has requested that we provide a professional opinion as to whether the imaging findings are related whole or in part to the injury in question.

878.0,"Reason for Exam: R/O CAUDA EQINA-SENSORY LOSS/PARESTHESIAS-C2           ******** ADDENDUM #1 ********     The CT chest from May 28, 2019 and CT abdomen/pelvis from May 29, 2019 (both performed at UAH) were reviewed. The multiple small lytic lesions with sclerotic rims scattered within the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae, sacrum and left and right ilium on the CT studies demonstrate subtle central hypointense T1 and heterogenous T2 signal. Some lesions have a subtle rim of T1 hyperintensity at their periphery. The MR appearance is nonspecific. Infectious, granulomatous and malignant etiologies would have to be considered in the differential. A PET/CT scan may be of benefit to determine if these lesions are metabolically active and assess for a potential site for biopsy.    HISTORY:   As above.     TECHNIQUE:   Large field-of-view sagittal T1 and T2 imaging of the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine was first obtained. Sagittal T2 imaging of the lumbar spine and axial T1 and T2 imaging from L2-3 to L5-S1 was then acquired.     FINDINGS:  Lumbar spine x-rays from May 2013 2019 (Grey Nuns Hospital), thoracic spine x-rays from May 9, 2019 (MIC Tawa Centre) and cervical spine x-rays from May 1, 2017 (Insight Medical Imaging) were reviewed.     CERVICAL SPINE:  Straightening of the cervical spine noted. Vertebral body heights are maintained. Prevertebral soft tissues, craniocervical junction and visualized posterior fossa structures are unremarkable. Marrow signal is unremarkable.     There is mild soft tissue prominence posterior to the odontoid, indenting the ventral thecal sac but not causing any spinal cord impingement. This is of doubtful significance. The odontoid itself is intact with no erosions or osseous destruction apparent. Atlanto-dental interval is normal.     The cervical spinal cord is normal. No spinal stenosis at any level.     Moderate disc space narrowing and small posterior disc-osteophyte complex noted at C5-6. This does not affect the spinal cord. Probable mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing at this level. NO significant degenerative changes in the remainder of the cervical spine.        THORACIC SPINE:  Alignment is unremarkable. Prevertebral soft tissues are unremarkable. Small Schmorl's nodes noted at some levels. No focal destructive osseous lesions.     Thoracic spinal cord and conus are normal. Conus terminates at the T12 level. No fatty filum terminale.     Small posterior disc-osteophyte complexes at the T7-8, T9-10, T10-11, T11-12 and T12-L1 levels indent the thecal sac but do not affect the spinal cord or exiting nerve roots. No significant spinal stenosis or neural foraminal stenosis at any level.        LUMBAR SPINE:  Five lumbar type vertebrae are present. There is ventral downsloping of the superior endplate of L1, which appears remote. There is mild downsloping of the superior endplate of L2 also, which also appears old. Heights of the other lumbar vertebral bodies are maintained. Moderately advanced degenerative endplate changes are present within the L3 and L4 vertebral bodies. Patchy fatty marrow within the L1 and L2 vertebral bodies and along the L5-S1 endplates is likely degenerative in etiology also.     At L1-2, there is mild loss of disc height. A small posterior disc bulge indents the thecal sac. There is no nerve root impingement or spinal stenosis. No significant neural foraminal narrowing.     At L2-3, disc height is preserved. There is diffuse hypointense T2 signal indicative of disc degeneration. A small annular disc bulge mildly indents the ventral thecal sac. There is no nerve root impingement, spinal stenosis or lateral recess narrowing. Mild bilateral facet degenerative changes.     At L3-4, there is moderate to severe loss of disc height eccentrically towards the right, associated with mild degenerative endplate changes and small anterior osteophytes. Mild bilateral facet degenerative changes and ligamentum flavum thickening noted. A small broad-based posterior disc-osteophyte complex indents the thecal sac and encroaches upon the inferior aspect of both neural foramina, more so on the right, resulting in moderate stenosis of the right neural foramen and mild narrowing of the left neural foramen. Slight narrowing of both lateral recesses noted. Slight transverse narrowing of the thecal sac but no significant spinal stenosis.     At L4-5, there is grade I anterolisthesis of 3 mm. This is likely secondary to moderate to severe bilateral facet arthropathy at this level, associated with thickening of the ligamentum flavum. Moderate-sized joint effusions noted bilaterally also. A broad-based posterior disc bulge indents the ventral thecal sac. There is an extradural lesion just above the disc level anterolaterally towards the left within the spinal canal, demonstrating heterogeneous T2 and hypointense T1 signal. This measures approximately 15 mm AP x 14 mm TR x 11 mm CC. Its etiology is unclear. It may represent an unusual perineural cyst, synovial cyst or chronic sequestered disc fragment. It compresses the thecal sac and effaces the left lateral recess, with the exiting left L4 nerve root stretched around it. Of note, this lesion was present in retrospect on a CT abdomen/pelvis study from July 5, 2017 (UAH), associated with some regional bony remodeling at that time, and similar in size. At the disc level, there   is severe stenosis of the left lateral recess, moderate narrowing of the right lateral recess, and moderate to severe spinal stenosis. Moderate to severe stenosis of the left neural foramen noted with effacement of the fat around the exiting left L4 nerve root. Mild narrowing of the right neural foramen. These findings are also similar to the 2017 CT study.     At L5-S1, there is mild loss of disc height posteriorly. There is a small shallow disc protrusion paracentrally on the left, abutting but not displacing the descending left S1 nerve root. Mild bilateral facet degenerative changes. Slight narrowing of the left lateral recess and moderate stenosis of the left neural foramen. No stenosis of the right lateral recess or right neural foramen. No spinal stenosis.     Visualized sacroiliac joints are unremarkable.     OPINION:  1. Normal spinal cord.     2. Mild degenerative changes of the cervical and thoracic spine.     3. Multilevel degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine. Unusual extradural lesion at the inferior L4 level anterolaterally towards the left, compressing the thecal sac and narrowing the left lateral recess. This is of uncertain etiology but appears grossly unchanged in size compared to a CT abdomen/pelvis study from 2017. Differential diagnosis includes a synovial cyst, atypical perineural cyst or chronic sequestered disc fragment.     4. Bilateral lateral recess stenoses (left greater than right), moderate to severe spinal stenosis and moderate to severe left neural foraminal stenosis at L4-5. Moderate stenosis of the left L5-S1 neural foramen. These findings are also similar to the 2017 CT examination.",0

Similar broad - based posterior disc bulge of moderate size compresses the ventral thecal sac. Bilateral spondylolysis of L5 noted with moderately advanced bilateral facet degenerative changes. These findings result in moderate to severe stenoses of both lateral recesses, moderate spinal mediastinum and superficial_puncture_wounds stenoses of both neural foramina with effacement of the perineural fat around both exiting L5 nerve roots. Appearances overall are not significantly changed. Sacrum appears intact. Mild degenerative changes of both sacroiliac joints. Prevertebral and posterior paraspinal soft tissues are unremarkable. OPINION: 1. No significant interval change. Grade I spondylolisthesis of L5 on S1 secondary to bilateral L5 spondylolysis and underlying facet degeneration. Endplate sclerosis, subchondral cyst formation and vacuum phenomenon ahead the disc at this level remain in keeping with advanced degenerative disc disease.

There is a disc dissection at L4-5 and L5-S1.   Lumbar spine is aligned normally. The vertebral body heights are normal. There is no narrow signs abnormality.   T11-T12: normal   T12-L1: Normal   L1-2: Normal   L3-4: The pedicles are congenitally shortened which results in a narrow central canal. There is a mild posterior disc bulge. CSF continues to surround the nerve roots. The neural foramen are widely patent bilaterally.   L4-5: There is disc height loss and disc dissection. A right paracentral disc bulge impingement the thecal sac and results in marked narrowing of the right lateral recess. The CSF is completed excluded from this level and there is severe central canal stenosis. The pedicles are congenitally short. There is no significant facet arthropathy. The neural foramen are widely patent.   L5-S1: There is a right paracentral disc protrusion with impingement on the thecal sac and results in narrowing of the right lateral recess. The CSF is completely excluded from this level compatible severe central canal stenosis. The neural foramen are patent bilaterally.   IMPRESSION  lumbization of S1 segment versus 6 lumbar type vertebral bodies. For this examine lowest vertebral body has been labeled as S1.   Congenitally short pedicles. This predisposes the patient to central canal stenosis.   Severe central canal stenosis at L4-L5 and L5-S1.

Vertebral body height appears preserved aside from mild superior endplate compression/degeneration at C6 and to minimal extent suspected at C7 as well.  Background marrow signal is unremarkable.  No convincing signal changes identified within the spinal cord.  No myelomalacia is suspected, but there is some mild compression as discussed below.       Above C4: There is mild disc desiccation but disc height is preserved.  No significant spondylosis is seen in the spinal canal and intervertebral foramina are widely patent.     C4-5: There is disc desiccation with mild anterior disc height loss and endplate degeneration.  No further spondylosis noted.  Spinal canal and intervertebral foramina widely patent.     C5-6: There is moderate degenerative disc disease with height loss and endplate change.  Moderate posterior disc osteophyte complex formation is present and extends to the uncovertebral joints, overall larger on the left side.  This results in mild spinal stenosis with effacement of the CSF in the thecal sac and with mild indentation of the spinal cord, more so on the left.  There is foraminal narrowing from the uncovertebral osteophytes to moderate to severe degree on the left and moderate degree on the right, and this may result in clinically significant exiting C6 nerve root impingement.     C6-7: There is disc desiccation with mild to moderate disc height loss.  Mild endplate degeneration is seen.  Mild posterior central focal disc protrusion is seen and mildly indents the thecal sac.  Moderate uncovertebral osteophytosis is seen bilaterally but is worse on the left.  The left foramen is moderately narrowed in the right foramen is mildly narrowed.  Minimal/mild narrowing of the spinal canal is less pronounced than at the C5-6 level.     C7-T4: There is mild disc desiccation at multiple levels but no significant disc height loss is seen.  Mild calcification of the posterior longitudinal ligament mildly encroaches upon the spinal canal and indents the thecal sac but does not appear to result in significant overall spinal stenosis.  Foramina appear widely patent.     IMPRESSION: There is considerable degenerative spondylosis at the C5-C7 levels, particularly C5-6.  There is associated degenerative disc height loss and endplate change as well as posterior disc bulging and herniation and uncovertebral osteophytosis.  This results in mild spinal stenosis at C5-6 with mild indentation of the spinal cord.  No myelomalacia noted.  Moderate to severe left C5-6 foraminal narrowing is seen, and to lesser moderate degree on the right at C5-6 more than on the left at C6-7.  Mild right C6-7 foraminal narrowing.

,"Radiographs of an lumbar spine performed October 22, 2018 are available for comparison. An MRI of the lumbar spine performed November 24, 2010 is also available for comparison. A clinical history of "" recurrent severe pain down the right leg "" has been provided. I note that the patient has a history of a left - sided disc herniation. TECHNICAL: Sagittal and axial T1 and T2_T3 - weighted sequences were performed. FINDINGS: This report assumes five lumbar - type vertebrae. A curvature is present convex to the right which may in part be related to patient positioning. The vertebral body heights are well maintained. The bone marrow signal is fairly monoethnic allowing for hemangiomata / fatty rests as well as degenerative endplate changes. The conus medullaris terminates normally at approximately the L1 level. At the S1 / 2 level, an underdeveloped disc is noted. No significant neural foraminal compromise or compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated. At the L5 / S1 level, at least moderate degenerative endplate changes are present along with moderate - to - advanced narrowing of the intervertebral disc. A small amount of vacuum occurrence is suspected within the intervertebral disc. Mild disc / osteophyte complex continues present posteriorly ringed the midline, which extends laterally protruding into the inferior aspect of the neural foramen bilaterally. The posterior disc / osteophyte complex appears to abut but Ididn't significantly displace or compress the traversing S1 nerve root bilaterally. The disc herniation present posteriorly eccentric to the left on the prior study performed November 24, 2010 has resolved in the interval. Degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints, mild on the right and minimal squarely when left. No significant neural foraminal compromise or compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated. At the L4 / 5 level, moderate degenerative endplate changes are present along with moderate narrowing of the intervertebral disc. Relatively minor disc / osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline, which extends laterally protruding into the inferior aspect of the neural foramen bilaterally. A superimposed moderate - sized disc protrusion / extrusion is present posteriorly straddling the midline but slightly more prominent to the right of midline and appears to abut and result in posterior displacement and compression of the traversing L5 nerve root bilaterally, more prominent on the right side. Mild degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints. There is borderline hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum. The findings are resulting in moderate compromise of the adjacent thecal sac. No significant neural foraminal compromise is appreciated.

Â   The lower thoracic and upper lumbar spine demonstrates no significant abnormality.  No concerning extraspinal abnormality.     Â   L2-3: Moderate facet arthropathy.    Â   L3-4:  There is evidence of marked hypertrophy of the posterior elements. There is a pseudoarthrosis between the dorsal spinous   process of L3 and L4, so-called Bastrop's phenomenon. This suture and likely communicates with bilateral severe facet arthropathy.  In addition, there is a large facet synovial cyst arising from the right L3-4 facet which measures 10 x 5 x 7 mm. Small broad-  based disc bulge combines with this marked hypertrophy of the posterior elements to result in severe canal stenosis at this level.  Facet arthropathy also results in mild bilateral foraminal stenosis.    Â   L4-5:  Posterior fusion at the L4-5 level. Good deep compression at the level of the canal. No significant foraminal stenosis.   Some scarring is seen, greatest in the right lateral recess.

SPINAL STENOSIS OR RADICULOPATHY           MRI LUMBAR SPINE     HISTORY: One-month history of pain radiating down posterior aspects of the legs with walking.  Query spinal stenosis or radiculopathy.     TECHNIQUE: Sagittal and axial T1 and T2 sequences of the lumbar spine.     COMPARISON: Lumbar spine x-rays February 8, 2021 (MIC).     FINDINGS: 5 lumbar type vertebrae are identified.  Mild chronic-appearing anterior height loss of T12 is observed.  Remaining vertebral body heights are normal.  Sagittal alignment of the lumbar spine is within normal limits.  Minor Modic type II signal alteration is seen throughout the imaged lower thoracic and lumbar spine anteriorly.  Type II Modic signal alteration is more extensive at L5-S1.  Marrow signal is otherwise unremarkable.  The conus medullaris terminates at the L2-3 level, within the lower limits of normal.  The imaged spinal cord is unremarkable.     T11-12 and T12-L1: Mild disc height loss with focal posterior disc protrusions.  No facet arthropathy.  Mild T11-12 spinal canal stenosis, with patent spinal canal at T12-L1.  Exit foramina through these levels are patent.  L1-2: Mild disc height loss with a circumferential disc bulge and posterior annular fissure.  No substantial facet arthropathy.  Spinal canal and exit foramina are patent.  L2-3: Minimal disc height loss with a mild circumferential disc bulge slightly more prominent to the left posterior region with a posterior annular fissure.  Mild bilateral facet arthropathy.  No spinal canal stenosis, though there is mild left lateral recess stenosis with contact but not distortion of the traversing left L3 nerve roots.  There is mild inferior narrowing of the left exit foramen.  The right exit foramen is patent.  L3-4: Mild disc height loss is seen, with a circumferential disc bulge.  Superimposed on this is a prominent posterior central disc protrusion.  Moderate bilateral facet arthropathy with ligamenta flava buckling is present.  There is resultant moderately severe spinal canal stenosis, with AP caliber of the spinal canal reduced to 5 mm, causing obliteration of the subarachnoid space and crowding of the cauda equina fibers to the point where individual fibers are not discernible.  There is definite impingement of the bilateral traversing L4 nerve roots.  Abnormalities at this level also result in mild inferior bilateral exit foraminal stenosis.  L4-5: Disc height is maintained, with a mild circumferential disc bulge.  Moderately severe bilateral facet arthropathy with ligamenta flava buckling is noted.  The spinal canal is patent.  There is mild inferior narrowing of the bilateral exit foramina.  L5-S1: Severe disc height loss is identified, with a circumferential disc osteophyte complex eccentric to the left.  Mild to moderate bilateral facet arthropathy is identified.  The spinal canal is patent, but there is moderate left subarticular recess stenosis with suspected contact but not distortion of the traversing left S1 nerve root.  Mild right and moderate left exit foraminal stenosis are also detected.     SUMMARY:  1.  Multilevel disc and facet degeneration is present as detailed above.  2.  Disc bulge with posterior central disc protrusion at L3-4 results in moderately severe spinal canal stenosis.  3.  Disc and facet degeneration cause moderate left subarticular recess stenosis at L5-S1, with contact but not distortion of the traversing left S1 nerve root.  4.  Disc and facet degeneration cause left exit foraminal stenosis at L5-S1.  There are numerous additional sites of mild exit foraminal stenosis in the mid to lower lumbar spine.     _____________________________________________________________",0

,"MR LUMBAR SPINE TOP_ARTICLE for Exam: LEFT LG PAIN IN THE BACKGROUND OF DISC DISEASE Sagittal / axial T1 / 2 sequences of the lumbar spine. Increased BMI. Mottled marrow signal may reflect a chronic hypoxic state. Visualized lower thoracic [to T10] lumbar vertebral body heights are maintained. Conus terminates at what is Discharge_Zone T12 - dimerization. Lower thoracic canal / foramina are patent. L1 - 2 disc shows mild right posterolateral annular bulging. The L1 nerve roots exit normally. The canal is patent. Mild degenerative facet Dakshin_Prahar overgrowth. The L2 - 3 disc shows degenerative osteophytic pitching_wedge with circumferential bulging that indents the ventral thecal sac and caudally narrows intervertebral foramina. The L2 nerve roots exit normally. Mild degenerative facet joint overgrowth. Central canal remains adequately patent. L3 - S1 discs show degenerative signal loss, narrowing, osteophytic lipping; with small circumferential disc osteophyte complexes that indent the ventral thecal sac and caudally narrow the intervertebral foramina. Further degrees of degenerative facet joint overgrowth, more advanced at L4 - 5. Degenerative facet joint overgrowth at L3 - 4 indents the posterolateral thecal protects_nerve_fibers and narrows the transverse dimension of the Wullar_Lake such that posterior epidural fat indents the posterior thecal sac. Discopathy indents the ventral thecal sac. Constellation of features results in moderate / marked stenosis of the thecal sac, its anteroposterior dimension reduced to about 5 - 1to mm in the midline. Lateral recess inlets are markedly narrowed. Attenuation of CSF and crowding of the cauda. Attenuated fat planes remain visible adjacent the exiting L3 nerve roots. Grade 1 anterolisthesis of the L3 vertebral body on L4 of about 4 mm. Uncovering of the posterior annulus with marked caudal narrowing of intervertebral foramina. Advanced overgrowth of the facet joints narrows the transverse dimension of the canal, a small posterior emergency_caesarean fat pad indenting the posterior thecal sac. Marked stenosis of the thecal sac, its anteroposterior and mediolateral dimensions reduced to a few millimeters. Virus_Infection fat planes remain visible adjacent the exiting L4 nerve roots. Effacing of CSF and crowding of the cauda. Attenuated fat planes remain visible adjacent the exiting L4 nerve roots. L5 - S1 disc shows mild broad - based posterior annular bulging that indents the ventral thecal sac. Central canal remains adequately patent. Traversing S1 nerve roots normal and symmetric. Some caudal narrowing of intervertebral foramina, the L5 nerve roots continuing to exit normally. Mild / moderate degenerative facet joint overgrowth. Opinion: Multilevel degenerative changes as detailed. Grade 1 L4 spondylolisthesis. Discopathy / facetopathy results in marked stenosis of the thecal sac at L4 - 5, and somewhat lesser stenosis of the thecal sac at L3 - 4. Surgical consultation may be prudent.",1

Mild straightening of the cervical lordosis may partially be positional in nature.  The spinal cord signal is unremarkable.  The visualized posterior fossa shows no salient abnormality.  Paraspinal musculature is grossly unremarkable.      C2-3:   Unremarkable      C3-4:   The disc height is preserved.  There is a thin posterior broad-based disc osteophyte complex associated with mild bilateral uncovertebral degenerative changes, left worse than right as well as mild bilateral facet osteoarthritis resulting in mild bilateral neural foramina narrowing.  No spinal canal stenosis.      C4-5:   Disc height is mildly reduced.  Mild left uncovertebral degenerative changes are present.  There is severe right hypotrophic facet osteoarthritis and mild left facet arthropathy resulting in moderate right and mild left neural foramina narrowing.  The spinal canal is widely patent.      C5-6:   2 mm retrolisthesis of C5 on C6.  The disc height is moderately reduced and there is mild bilateral uncovertebral degenerative changes, worse on the left than on the right.

Vertebral body heights are maintained. There are 5 lumbar-type vertebra. Multilevel   vertebral body hemangiomas are noted. No suspicious bone marrow signal abnormality.       There is constitutionally narrowing of the spinal canal, particularly at the lower lumbar levels distal to L2.       At L2/3, there is shallow circumferential noncompressive disc bulge which just touches the descending left L3 nerve root in the   lateral recess without definite compression. There is bilateral neural foraminal stenosis at this level secondary to loss of   intervertebral disc height, shallow disc bulge and endplate osteophytosis.       At L3/4, there is mild to moderate central canal stenosis secondary to combination of constitutionally narrowed canal, shallow   posterior disc bulge, moderate facet joint degeneration and flaval buckling. There is bilateral lateral recess stenosis with   possible compression of the descending L4 nerve roots bilaterally. No significant neural foraminal stenosis.       At L4/5, there is moderate to severe central canal stenosis secondary to combination of constitutionally narrowed canal, shallow   posterior disc bulge, severe bulky facet joint degeneration and flaval buckling with crowding of the cauda equina stenosis of both  lateral recesses with probable compression of the descending L5 nerve roots bilaterally. There is left-sided neural foraminal   stenosis.       L5/S1, there is shallow noncompressive posterior disc bulge. No significant central canal stenosis. No significant neural   foraminal stenosis. There is mild bilateral facet joint degeneration.       Shallow noncompressive disc bulges are seen elsewhere throughout the proximal lumbar and distal thoracic spine up to the level of  T11 with no significant central canal or neural foraminal stenosis at these levels. There is severe left L1/2 facet joint   degeneration.       Unremarkable appearances of the imaged distal spinal cord and conus medullaris.       Small bilateral renal cortical cysts are noted.          CONCLUSION:    Moderate to severe L4/5 central canal stenosis with probable compression of the descending L5 nerve roots bilaterally in the   lateral recesses.       Mild to moderate L3/4 central canal stenosis.

FINDINGS:  The lowest complete lumbar disc space is defined as L5-S1 for the purposes of this  report.  There is a slight straightening of the natural lumbar lordosis potentially due to an  element of muscle spasm. Lumbar vertebral height and alignment are otherwise  preserved. No fractures. No spondylolisthesis. There is degenerative disc disease at  L4-5 as detailed below. The remaining lumbar discs are reasonably well preserved,  although there are some prominent anterior endplate osteophytes at L3-4 and smaller  endplate osteophytes at the other lumbar levels.  The conus medullaris lies at L1.  DISCS:  T12-L1 - Minor broad-based posterior disc bulge. No spinal canal or neural foraminal  stenosis.  L1-2 - Normal disc. No spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis.  L2-3 - Normal disc. No spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis.  L3-4 - Normal disc. No spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis. Prominent anterior endplate osteophytes on the left side.  L4-5 - Disc desiccation with mild loss of disc height and a small posterior annular tear.  There is a small broad-based posterior disc bulge. There are severe bilateral facet joint  degenerative changes. There is a 6 mm ovoid lesion at the medial aspect of the right  L4-5 facet joint extending into the lateral recess, likely representing a synovial cyst,  although there is no significant fluid signal. There are congenitally shortened pedicles.  The combination of these findings is resulting in severe spinal stenosis with some  effacement of the posterior epidural fat. There is mild buckling of the cauda equina  proximal to this. There is severe bilateral lateral recess stenosis with impingement on  the descending L5 nerve roots bilaterally. There is mild right neural foraminal  narrowing without exiting nerve root impingement.  L5-S1 - Normal disc. No spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis. Mild bilateral facet  joint degenerative changes.  Other: There is a large exophytic cyst arising from the lower pole of the left kidney,  measuring approximately 7.2 cm in diameter. Probable small exophytic cyst in the  interpolar region of the right kidney.  OPINION:  1. Severe spinal stenosis at L4-5 secondary to a small broad-based posterior  disc bulge, severe facet joint arthropathy and a new 6 mm right L4-5 facet joint  synovial cyst extending into the right lateral recess.

Sagittal and coronal STIR imaging of the lower lumbar spine and complete sacrum was also acquired.     FINDINGS:  Comparison made to the CTA abdomen/pelvis from May 31, 2017 and CT colonography study from March 30, 2015 (both performed at Sturgeon Hospital). Lumbar spine x-rays from September 9, 2019 (Insight Medical Imaging) were also reviewed.     Five lumbar vertebrae are assumed. Straightening of the lumbar lordosis. Similar mild curvature convex left centered at L4. Vertebral body heights are maintained. Mild degenerative endplate changes at L2-3. Small fatty rests or intraosseous hemangiomas within multiple vertebrae, of doubtful significance.     Conus medullaris to the extent visualized is unremarkable, terminating at the L1 level. No fatty filum terminale.     There is a large, CSF signal intensity, lobulated and septated cystic structure within the sacral spinal canal, extending into the lower lumbar spinal canal up to the inferior L4 level. The lesion has multiple loculations, most, if not all, of which appear to communicate with each other. There is marked expansion of the sacral spinal canal, with prominent scalloping of the posterior margins of the S1, S2 and S3 vertebral bodies. There is marked thinning of the S2 and S3 vertebral bodies in particular. Locules extend into the S2-3 and S3-4 neural foramina, with a small component extending into the right S1-2 neural foramen also. The lumbar canal component of the lesion is situated posterolaterally towards the left, causing expansion of the lumbar spinal canal and remodeling of the posterior elements. The lumbar thecal sac is displaced anterolaterally towards the right. Posterior scalloping of the L2-L5 vertebral bodies noted. All of these findings are not significantly changed from the   prior CT studies, allowing for differences in modality.     Dimensions of this cystic lesion are 2.9 cm AP x 5.8 cm TR x 13.1 cm CC.     At T12-L1, the disc is normal. No spinal stenosis or neural foraminal stenosis.     At L1-2, disc height and signal are reasonably maintained. A small posterior disc bulge indents the ventral thecal sac and slightly encroaches upon the inferior aspect of both neural foramina. No nerve root impingement, spinal stenosis or neural foraminal stenosis.     At L2-3, there is moderate loss of disc height with diffuse hypointense T2 disc signal indicative of disc degeneration. A small broad-based posterior disc bulge indents the ventral thecal sac. No significant neural foraminal narrowing, spinal stenosis or lateral recess stenosis. Minor facet degenerative changes.     At L3-4, disc height is preserved. Subtle T2 hypointense signal reflecting early disc degeneration. A small, shallow posterior disc-osteophyte complex indents the ventral thecal sac but does not cause any nerve root impingement. No spinal stenosis, neural foraminal stenosis or lateral recess narrowing. Minor facet degenerative changes on the right.     At L4-5, disc height is preserved. Diffuse hypointense T2 disc signal indicative of disc degeneration. A small to moderate-sized broad-based posterior disc-osteophyte complex compresses the ventral thecal sac. This abuts but does not displace the descending S1 nerve roots. No significant lateral recess stenosis or superimposed spinal stenosis on a degenerative basis. Slight narrowing of both neural foramina but no impingement of either exiting L4 nerve root. Aforementioned cyst extends into the left lateral recess and compresses the descending left L5 nerve root, displacing it anteromedially.     At L5-S1, disc height is preserved. Diffuse hypointense T2 disc signal. A small broad-based posterior disc-osteophyte complex indents the ventral thecal sac. It slightly encroaches upon the inferior aspect of both neural foramina, resulting in mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing. Mild facet degenerative changes. No evidence of spondylolysis or significant spondylolisthesis. There is thickening or tethering of the ventral thecal sac at the mid S1 level, which may involve the descending left S2 nerve root. Both descending S1 nerve roots are displaced anteriorly by the cystic lesion.     Prevertebral soft tissues and visualized sacroiliac joints are unremarkable.     OPINION:  1. Multilobulated and septated CSF signal intensity cystic lesion consistent with a large expansile Tarlov cyst situated within the sacral spinal canal, extending into the lower lumbar spinal canal. Adjacent bony remodeling implies this is a long-standing lesion. It causes mild compression and displacement of the thecal sac, compressing and displacing the descending L5 and bilateral S1 nerve roots anteriorly. Size and extent of the cyst are not grossly changed going back to the 2015 CT study.     2. Degenerative disc disease from L2-3 to L5-S1.

657.0,"FINDINGS: A mild broad-based rightward curvature of the spine is similar to previous radiographs. There  is straightening of lordosis above L4. Vertebral body height is preserved and background marrow signal is  normal. The distal end of the spinal cord is normal in signal, caliber and position. No significant  spondylosis is seen above L2 in the lumbar and included lower thoracic spine.  At L2-L3, there is disc desiccation with minimal-mild disc height loss. There is minimal-mild posterior disc  bulging and there is moderate to severe facet degeneration, but the spinal canal and intervertebral  foramina are widely patent.  At L3-L4, there is disc desiccation with mild overall disc height loss. There is at least mild circumferential  disc bulging with mild retrolisthesis. Moderate facet degeneration is present and there is mild to moderate  narrowing of the lateral recess of the canal, but without nerve root impingement/compression. The  central canal is widely patent. Only mild foraminal narrowing.  At L4-L5, there is disc desiccation with moderate disc height loss and mild retrolisthesis. Moderate  circumferential disc bulging is seen along with at least moderate facet degeneration. Bilateral facet joint  effusion is seen. The central canal is widely patent, but there is mild narrowing of the lateral recesses and  foramina. No nerve root compression/impingement.  At L5-S1, there is disc desiccation with moderate to severe disc height loss seen more so posteriorly.  There is mild posterior disc bulging seen more so toward the right side and there is moderate facet  degeneration. Mild narrowing of the lateral recess of the spinal canal is more pronounced on the right,  but the central canal is widely patent. Mild foraminal narrowing is noted on the right. No nerve root compression.  IMPRESSION:  There is overall at least moderate degenerative lumbar spondylosis, particularly below the L2 level and  with multilevel mild retrolisthesis and with mildly altered curvature. Although there is some narrowing of  lateral recesses of the spinal canal, there does not appear to be significant narrowing of the central canal.  There is only mild foraminal narrowing. No nerve root compression/impingement is identified",0
,"Findings: Â Direct comparison is made with the prior lumbar MRI of 2017. Â Identification of my L5 segment is defined by the location of the iliolumbar ligament. Â A normal conus medullaris terminates at L1. Â Multilevel spondylosis and moderate - to - severe degenerative disc disease are again seen. This has progressed in some levels. Â Degenerative bone marrow signal change is evident in multiple levels. No other significant abnormality of bone marrow signal is seen. Â Central canal is reduced in two levels as discussed below. Â In T11 - 12, a chronic broad posterior disc - osteophyte complex results in mild central stenosis Michael_Wuertz_Santiago_Casilla some distortion of cord and thecal sac contour. This may be the etiology of the thoracic myelopathy described on the history for the 2017 MRI request. However, cord signal remains normal, showing no edema or evidence for myelomalacia. The mild stenosis appears relatively stable. Â In T12 - L1 and in L1 - 2, minor broad posterior disc bulges should stable, causing no neural compromise. The facet joints show minor degenerative change without definite osteoarthritis. Â In L2 - 3, severe disc degeneration has nearly obliterated the intervertebral disc, representing a significant adverse change from 2017 when the disc was near normal. There is minor retrolisthesis. A broad posterior disc bulge associated with the disc degeneration is slightly scientist_Seth_Brundle towards the right side. There is now mild central stenosis, with appreciable distortion in the thecal sac contour. However, no convincing nerve root compromise is seen, as perineural fat is still preserved bilaterally with respect to overcorrecting and descending nerves. Mild / moderate osteoarthritis of the bilateral facet joints is present. Â Previously seen fluid between spinous processes of L2 and L3 has resolved, leaving advanced degenerative change. Â L3 - 4 hangs stable. A broad posterior disc bulge slightly indents the ventral thecal sac but does not cause any convincing neural compromise. Previously suggested mild central stenosis shows no adverse change. Choppy_Session severe bilateral facet OA is evident. Â L4 - 5 is stable. The broad posterior disc bulge indents the ventral thecal sac but does not cause convincing neural compromise. The previously described mild bilateral foraminal stenosis shows no progression. Perineural fat is still preserved. Severe bilateral facet OA is again evident, with minimal degenerative grade 1 anterolisthesis which was previously present. Â L5 - S1 is stable. The minimal broad posterior disc bulge barely touches the thecal sac because of the capacious size of the central canal in this level. Neural elements remain fully intact with no compromise. Severe bilateral facet OA is again seen. Â Impression: Â Multilevel degenerative disc disease and spondylosis are again seen. The only adverse change from 2017 is the Marcy_NanoCenter of new severe degenerative disc disease in L2 - 3 which was previously near normal. Â The above produces a new level of mild central stenosis. Â Prior mild central stenosis in T11 - T12 remains stable; while there may plenty be mild cord compression, the cord does not show any edema or evidence of myelomalacia. Clinical correlation is required regarding any persistence of the thoracic myelopathy clinically described in 2017. Â Again no other potential neural compromise is seen on this study, and there is no specific site of convincing nerve root compromise. Â Moderate to severe facet OA is present in most levels.",1

Vertebral body heights are preserved. There are multilevel mild to moderate   degenerative endplate changes with loss of intervertebral disc heights in association. Scattered vertebral body hemangiomata   noted.       At T9/10, there is a focal partially calcified posterior disc extrusion measuring 8 mm AP and up to 15 mm transverse. Extruded   disc material measures 13 mm in total craniocaudal dimension, extending approximately 5 mm superior to the inferior T9 endplate   and approximately 4 mm inferior to the superior T10 endplate. This causes posterior displacement and anterior   flattening/indentation of the spinal cord with subtle increased intrasubstance cord T2 signal at this level. The central canal   measures 6 mm AP at the level of the extrusion.       There are further shallower posterior disc protrusions seen elsewhere within the thoracic spine. At T5/6, there is a right   parasagittal broad-based disc protrusion which just indents the right anterolateral margin of the cord and causes mild leftward   deviation of the cord without any convincing intrinsic cord signal abnormality at this level. This disc protrusion measures 8 mm   AP and extends superior to the inferior T5 endplate by approximately 6 mm. Further shallow noncompressive posterior disc   protrusions at T7/T8 and T2/T3 noted.       No significant central canal stenosis demonstrated elsewhere throughout the thoracic spine. No significant thoracic neural   foraminal stenosis.       The remainder of the imaged spinal cord and conus medullaris is unremarkable.       CONCLUSION:    Prominent central disc extrusion at T9/10 causing significant central canal stenosis, flattening/indentation of the spinal cord   and subtle localized intrinsic cord signal abnormality as described, compatible with myelopathic change at this level. A spinal   surgical consult is advised for further management.       Degenerative changes and further noncompressive disc protrusions elsewhere throughout the thoracic spine as described.         ",0

Â   TECHNIQUE:  Standard radiculopathy protocol, consisting of sagittal T1 and T2 imaging from T11-12 to the upper sacrum and axial T1 and T2 imaging from L3-4 to L5-S1.  Â   FINDINGS:  Comparison made to the MR lumbar spine from June 2, 2019 (Royal Alexandra Hospital). Lumbar spine x-rays from January 18, 2020 (Sturgeon Hospital) were also reviewed.  Â   Five lumbar type vertebrae are assumed. Grade I spondylolisthesis of L4 on L5 of 5 mm is slightly worse. Alignment is otherwise normal. Marrow signal is normal. Vertebral body heights are maintained. Prevertebral soft tissues are unremarkable.  Â   Conus medullaris is normal, terminating at the L1 level. No fatty filum terminale.  Â   The T11-12 through L2-3 discs are normal. No spinal stenosis or neural foraminal stenosis at these levels.  Â   At L3-4, disc height is preserved. Minor peripheral hypointense T2 disc signal indicative of disc degeneration. Mild annular disc bulging but no nerve root impingement. No spinal stenosis or significant neural foraminal narrowing. Facet joints are unremarkable.  Â   At L4-5, mild loss of disc height is now evident, with similar diffuse hypointense T2 disc signal. There is unroofing of the posterior disc margin, with a small broad-based disc bulge indenting the ventral thecal sac. Small annular fissure at the left posterolateral margin of the disc. Moderately advanced bilateral facet degenerative changes with bilateral joint effusions and mild ligamentum flavum thickening. Combination of these findings results in mild stenoses of both lateral recesses and mild spinal stenosis. Slight narrowing of both neural foramina but no impingement of either exiting L4 nerve root. Appearances are unchanged from the prior MR study.  Â   There is a lobulated T1 hypointense focus demonstrating central hyperintense T2 signal and peripheral incomplete hypointense T2 rim situated at the anterolateral aspect of the left L4-5 facet joint, measuring 8 mm AP x 9 mm TR, consistent with a synovial cyst. It is larger and more conspicuous compared to the 2019 study. It does not affect the exiting left L4 nerve root, latter situated immediately ventral to it. It is remote from the thecal sac.

X-RAYS BILATERAL PARS INTERARTICULARIS DEFECTS AFFECTING L3 WITH GRADE 2 ANTEROLISTHESIS OF L3 ON L4 ASSOCIATED WITH DEGENERATIVE DISC DISEASE AND VACUUM PHENOMENON.    Â   Radiographs of the lumbar spine performed 17 August, 2020 and 13 June, 2016 are available for comparison.  Â   A clinical history of ""chronic back pain since motor vehicle accident in 1993"" has been provided.  Â   TECHNICAL:  Â   Sagittal and axial T1- and T2-weighted sequences were performed.  Â   FINDINGS:  Â   Transitional anatomy is present at the level of the lumbosacral junction. For the purposes of this report (as well as to remain consistent with the prior radiograph reports), the inferiormost fully-formed disc will be labeled the L5/S1 level. Note is made of an underdeveloped disc at the S1/2 level as well as an anterolisthesis of the body of L3 with respect to the body of L4. A mild curvature is present convex to the left. The vertebral body heights are well-maintained and appear unchanged in the interval. The bone marrow signal is fairly homogeneous allowing for degenerative endplate changes at several levels, most notably at the L4/5 level and at the L3/4 level. The conus medullaris terminates normally at approximately the level of the T12/L1 intervertebral disc. The a small incidental perineural cyst is noted within the sacral spinal canal at the S2 level.   Â   At the S1/2 level, an underdeveloped disc is noted. No significant neural foraminal compromise or compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.  Â   At the L5/S1 level, the intervertebral disc is unremarkable. A pseudoarthrosis with associated degenerative change is present involving the transverse process of L5 with the sacrum on the left side. Mild degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints. No significant neural foraminal compromise or compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.  Â   At the L4/5 level, a small anterior osteophyte is noted straddling the midline, more prominent to the left of midline. Degenerative endplate changes are present, more prominent eccentric to the left. Narrowing of the intervertebral disc is present, advanced on the left and mild to moderate on the right. A small amount of vacuum phenomenon is present within the intervertebral disc eccentric to the left. Disc/osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline which extends laterally protruding into the inferior aspect of the neural foramen bilaterally, more prominent on the left side. The posterior disc/osteophyte complex does not appear to involve the traversing L5 nerve roots. Degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints, moderate on the left and mild on the right. There is borderline hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum. The findings are resulting in moderate compromise of the left neural foramen and minimal/mild compromise of the right neural foramen. No   significant compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.  Â   At the L3/4 level, moderate-to-advanced degenerative endplate changes are present along with marked narrowing of the intervertebral disc. Vacuum phenomenon is present within the intervertebral disc. A defect is present within the pars interarticularis bilaterally at the L3 level with an associated anterolisthesis of the body of L3 with respect to the body of L4 measuring approximately 8 mm resulting in uncovering of the posterior aspect of the intervertebral disc. Disc/osteophyte complex is present laterally protruding into the region of the neural foramen bilaterally. Mild degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints. The findings are resulting in severe compromise of the right neural foramen and moderate-to-severe compromise of the left neural foramen. No significant compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.  Â   The remainder of the visualized levels is unremarkable allowing for minor degenerative disc and facet joint changes.   Â   Atheromatous irregularity is present involving the abdominal aorta extending into the iliac arteries bilaterally. To the extent visualized, regional soft tissue structures are otherwise unremarkable.  Â   IMPRESSION:  Â   Transitional anatomy is present at the level of the lumbosacral junction, as stated above. Radiographic correlation is recommended in an effort to ensure accurate localization, especially prior to any interventional procedure.  Â   Degenerative change is present involving the intervertebral disc and the facet joints at multiple levels resulting in neural foraminal compromise at several levels, most striking bilaterally at the L3/4 level as well as on the left side at the L4/5 level, as detailed above. Bilateral spondylolysis is present at the L3 level resulting in a grade 2 anterolisthesis of the body of L3 with respect to the body of L4 and associated bilateral neural foraminal compromise, as discussed. The degree of anterolisthesis at the L3/4 level appears relatively unchanged when compared with the radiographs performed 17 August, 2020.   Â ",1
,"TECHNIQUE: Routine lumbar spine sequences with axial T1 / T2 sequences from L3 - S1 and a further axial T2 sequence from T12 - U#####. CORRELATION: Comparison is made with the x - rays dated June 15, 2020, and with the MRI dated August 20, 2017. FINDINGS: The lowest complete lumbar disc space is defined as L5 - S1 for the## purposes of this report. There is a slight straightening of the natural lumbar lordosis potentially due to an element of muscle ruptured_cruciate_knee_ligament. Lumbar vertebral height and alignment are otherwise preserved. No fractures. No spondylolisthesis. There is degenerative disc disease at L4 - 5 as detailed below. The remaining lumbar discs are reasonably well preserved, although there are some prominent anterior endplate osteophytes at L3 - 4 and smaller endplate osteophytes at entire other lumbar levels. The conus medullaris lies at L1. DISCS: T12 - L1 - Minor broad - based posterior disc bulge. No spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis. L1 - 2 - Normal disc. No spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis. L2 - 3 - Normal disc. No spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis. L3 - 4 - album_Un_Dia disc. No spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis. Prominent anterior endplate osteophytes on the left side. L4 - 5 - Disc desiccation with mild loss of disc ft and a small posterior annular tear. There is a Large broad - based posterior disc bulge. There are severe bilateral facet joint degenerative changes. There is a 6 mm ovoid lesion at the medial factor of the right L4 - 5 facet joint extending into the lateral recess, likely representing a synovial cyst, although there is no significant fluid signal. There are congenitally shortened pedicles. The combination of these findings is resulting in severe spinal stenosis with some effacement of the posterior epidural fat. There is mild buckling of Rink_Rap cauda equina proximal to this. There is severe bilateral lateral recess stenosis with impingement on the descending L5 nerve roots bilaterally. There is mild right neural foraminal narrowing without exiting nerve root impingement. L5 - S1 - Normal disc. No spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis. Mild bilateral facet joint degenerative changes. Other: There is a large exophytic cyst arising from the lower pole of the left kidney, measuring approximately 7. 2 cm in diameter. Probable small exophytic cyst in the interpolar region of the right kidney. OPINION: 1. Severe spinal stenosis at L4 - 5 secondary to a small broad - based posterior disc bulge, severe facet joint arthropathy and a new 2_ mm right L4 - 5 facet joint synovial cyst extending into the right lateral recess. The appearances represent a deterioration from the previous MRI. 2. Mild degenerative changes elsewhere within the lumbar spine, but no further evidence of significant disc bulges, spinal stenosis or neural foraminal stenosis. 3.

This measures 1 cm transversely at its base and extends up to 8 mm   posterior to expected confines of the disc.  This extends up to 1.2 cm craniocaudad and extends posterior to the L4 vertebral body  into the region of the lateral recess.  This may well be impinging upon the descending right L4 nerve root within the lateral   recess.  This does cause some flattening of the right anterolateral thecal sac although there is no significant central canal   stenosis.  There is peripheral enhancement consistent with inflammatory change.  This also causes some slight posterior   displacement of the ascending right L5 nerve prior to passage into the lateral recess.  There is moderately severe right neural   foraminal narrowing.

,"MR L - SPINE NO CONTRAST HISTORY: PT COMPLAINING OF LBP. AN ONGOING ISSUE, HAD MRI 2015, SEE ATTACHED. PT DEVELOPED LATELY MOTOR SXS, THEREFORE NEEDS REPEAT MRI. ? ANY PROGRESSION LUMBAR ISSUES Clinical History: Low back pain. Comparison: 2015 Findings: The conus ends normally and is normal in caliber and signal. Mild to moderate disc space narrowing with endplate spurring at L1 - 2 through L4 - 5. Vertebral heights keep maintained. At L1 - 2, there is generalized disc bulge and osteophytosis with a small central disc protrusion which has increased in size slightly. This indents the thecal sac centrally. Degenerative disease combined with thickening of ligamentum flavum and facet arthrosis results in mild overall narrowing of the central canal and neural foramina. Unlike L2 - 0xff, there is ego_dystonic disc bulge and osteophytosis with thickening of the facet degenerative change. The result is moderate narrowing of central canal, progressive from previous. Mild foraminal narrowing. At L3 - 4, degenerative disc bulge and osteophytosis with thickening of the lumen of flavum and moderate facet degenerative change. The OTHER_PEOPLE effect is moderate narrowing of central canal and effacement of thecal sac, progressive from previous. Mild to moderate foraminal narrowing. Perhaps L4 - 5, there is generalized disc bulge and osteophytosis with thickening of the ligamentum flavum and severe facet degenerative change. The combined effect is moderate narrowing of central canal and effacement of the thecal sac, similar to previous. Facet degenerative change allows for slight anterolisthesis of L4 on L5 by couple millimeters. Mild to moderate foraminal narrowing. At L5 - S1, there is generalized disc slender and osteophytosis, known well as facet degenerative change. The marred is relatively_benign narrowing of spinal canal and neural foramina.

The left-side facet demonstrates degenerative  change, with the right side normal.  Bilateral ligamenta flava hypertrophy present.  A mild circumferential disc bulge is present, with subsequent mild indentation on the anterior aspect of the thecal sac.  The  vertebral foramen is still adequately patent.  Â   L3/4 LEVEL:  Both recesses, neural foramina and exiting nerve root sleeves appear relatively normal.  Both facets demonstrate early  degenerative change, with significant ligamenta flava hypertrophy.  Secondary to this, lateral narrowing of the vertebral foramen  is noted.  A mild circumferential disc bulge is present, with the anteroposterior diameter of the vertebral foramen still maintained.  Â   L4/5 LEVEL:  Narrowing of both neural foramina are present, right more than left side, and early compression of the exiting L4 nerve root  sleeve should be considered.  Both facets demonstrate trivial degenerative change, with significant ligamenta flava hypertrophy.  In combination with a mild circumferential disc bulge the anteroposterior diameter of the vertebral foramen is narrowed,  measuring 10.4 mm, which is consistent with spinal stenosis.  Secondary to this, flattening of the anterior aspect of the thecal  sac is noted, as well as early suspected compression of both descending L5 roots at pre recess level.  In association with  ligamenta flava hypertrophy, lateral narrowing of the vertebral foramen is also present.  Â   L5/S1 LEVEL:  Mild left side neural foraminal narrowing is noted, with the right side appearing unremarkable.  No definite exiting nerve root  sleeve compression.  Both facets demonstrate degenerative change, with facet hypertrophy.  In combination with a circumferential  disc bulge, compression of the left side descending S1 root at pre recess level is noted.

L  -L4, 2009     An MRI of the lumbar spine performed 19 September, 2014 is available for comparison.     A clinical history of ""severe spinal stenosis for possible surgery"" has been provided.     TECHNICAL:     Sagittal and axial T1- and T2-weighted sequences were performed.     FINDINGS:     This report assumes five lumbar-type vertebrae. A subtle curvature is present convex to the right which may in part be related to patient positioning. The vertebral body heights are relatively well-maintained allowing for Schmorl's node formation associated with the endplates throughout the lumbar region and are stable in appearance when compared with the prior study performed in September of 2014. The bone marrow signal is fairly homogeneous allowing for hemangiomata/fatty rests as well as degenerative endplate changes at several levels. There is evidence for a prior posterior decompression procedure at the L4 level with associated postoperative changes within the overlying soft tissues posterior to the osseous spinal column. The conus medullaris terminates normally at approximately the L1 level.     At the S1/2 level, an underdeveloped disc is noted. No significant neural foraminal compromise or compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.     At the L5/S1 level, a prominent anterior osteophyte is noted straddling the midline. Moderate degenerative endplate changes are present along with moderate-to-advanced narrowing of the intervertebral disc. A trace amount of vacuum phenomenon is suspected within the intervertebral disc. Disc/osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline which extends laterally protruding into the inferior aspect of the neural foramen bilaterally. A minuscule focus of abnormal increased T2 signal is present within the disc annulus posteriorly to the right of midline, compatible with an annular fissure. Degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints, mild-to-moderate on the left and mild on the right. The findings are resulting in moderate-to-severe compromise of the right neural foramen and moderate compromise of the left neural foramen. No significant compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.     At the L4/5 level, moderate degenerative endplate changes are present, more prominent eccentric to the left. Narrowing of the intervertebral disc is present, fairly advanced on the left and moderate on the right. Disc/osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline which extends laterally protruding into the inferior aspect of the neural foramen bilaterally. The posterior disc/osteophyte complex appears to involve the traversing L5 nerve root bilaterally, more prominent on the left side. Moderate degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints. There is hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum. The findings are resulting in moderate compromise of the adjacent thecal sac as well as severe compromise of the right neural foramen and moderate inferior neural foraminal compromise on the left. Subtle clumping of the nerve roots is noted within the thecal sac at this level, raising the possibility of arachnoiditis.     At the L3/4 level, moderate degenerative endplate changes are present, more prominent eccentric to the left. Narrowing of the intervertebral disc is present, advanced on the left and moderate-to-advanced on the right. Disc/osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline which extends laterally protruding into the inferior aspect of the neural foramen bilaterally, slightly more striking on the left side. A superimposed small disc extrusion persists posteriorly straddling the midline, but more prominent to the left of midline, which has diminished in size when compared with the prior study and likely involves the traversing L4 nerve root. Mild degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints. The findings are resulting in the severe compromise of the left neural foramen and mild-to-moderate compromise of the right neural foramen as well as minimal/mild compromise of the adjacent thecal sac.     At the L2/3 level, a prominent anterior osteophyte is noted straddling the midline. Moderate degenerative endplate changes are present, more prominent eccentric to the right. Narrowing of the intervertebral disc is present, advanced on the right and moderate on the left. Disc/osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline which extends laterally protruding into the inferior aspect of the neural foramen bilaterally. A minuscule focus of abnormal increased T2 signal is noted within the disc annulus posteriorly, compatible with an annular fissure. The posterior disc/osteophyte complex appears to contact but not significantly displace the traversing L3 nerve roots. Mild-to-moderate degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints. The findings are resulting in moderate compromise of the left neural foramen and mild compresses of the right neural foramen. No significant compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.     At the L1/2 level, a small anterior osteophyte is noted straddling the midline. Mild degenerative endplate changes are present along with mild-to-moderate narrowing of the intervertebral disc. A minuscule shallow disc protrusion is present posteriorly in the midline which does not appear to involve the traversing L2 nerve roots. Minor disc/osteophyte complex is present laterally protruding into the inferior aspect of the right neural foramen. Mild degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints. The findings are resulting in minimal compromise of the right neural foramen. The left neural foramen is patent and no significant compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.     The remainder of the visualized levels are unremarkable allowing for at least mild degenerative facet joint changes.     Atheromatous irregularity is present throughout the abdominal aorta extending into the iliac arteries bilaterally. Diffuse atrophic change is present involving the posterior paraspinal musculature, most prominent inferior to the L4/5 level. To the extent visualized, the regional soft tissue structures are otherwise unremarkable.     IMPRESSION:     Findings compatible with the prior posterior decompression procedure at the L4 level. Degenerative changes are present involving the intervertebral disc and the facet joints at multiple levels resulting in neural foraminal compromise at several levels as well as moderate compromise of the thecal sac/spinal canal at the L4/5 level, as detailed above. The degenerative disc and facet joint changes as well as the resultant neural foraminal compromise have progressed since the prior study performed 19 September, 2014. The degree of compromise of the thecal sac at the L4/5 level also appears to have slightly progressed when compared with the prior study performed 19 September, 2014.     A disc extrusion persists posteriorly straddling the midline, but more prominent to the left of midline at the L3/L4 level which has diminished in size with less resultant compromise of the adjacent thecal sac when compared with the prior study performed 19 September, 2014.       ",0
797.0,"CLINICAL HISTORY: Worsening radiculopathy type pain radiating from left neck to left shoulder and arm, with numbness and tingling weakness.      TECHNIQUE: MRI of the cervical spine was performed with sagittal T1 and T2 sequences through the entire cervical spine as well as axial medic 3-D T2 sequences from C2-C3 to C7-T1.      COMPARISON: No relevant prior MRI. Radiographs of the cervical spine from 11 May, 2020.      FINDINGS:      Normal curvature and alignment of the cervical spine. Vertebral bodies are normal in height without evidence of fracture. No significant bone marrow signal abnormality.      There is an intramedullary cervical cord lesion at the level of C2 to the left of midline anterolaterally, measuring approximately 4 x 4 x 5 mm (AP x TR x CC). This lesion is occult on T1 weighted sequences, demonstrating isointense to mildly increased T2 signal intensity centrally compared to adjacent cord, with surrounding peripheral T2 hypointense rim. The T2 hypointense rim is even darker on axial T2 medic sequences.      No additional spinal cord lesion identified within the cervical and visualized upper thoracic cord. No hydrosyringomyelia.      Prevertebral cervical and paraspinal soft tissues are within normal limits. Visualized intracranial contents, posterior fossa and craniocervical junction are unremarkable.      Degenerative disease:      Atlantoaxial and atlantooccipital joints are intact without significant degenerative change. At C2-3, C6-7, and C7-T1 there is no large disc bulge or protrusion. No significant spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis at these levels. Vertebral bodies and intervertebral disc spaces of the visualized upper thoracic spine are unremarkable.      At C3-4, small posterior disc osteophyte complex and uncovertebral hypertrophy effaces the ventral CSF space and results in mild narrowing of the spinal canal. Minimal bilateral facet degeneration. No neural foraminal stenosis.      At C4-5, minor posterior disc osteophyte complex and uncovertebral hypertrophy results in mild spinal canal stenosis. Minimal bilateral facet degeneration. No neural foraminal stenosis.      At C5-6, large left paracentral and medial foraminal soft disc protrusion severely narrows the left lateral recess and neural foramina, and may contact the exiting left C5 nerve root. Mild spinal canal stenosis. Minimal bilateral facet degeneration.      IMPRESSION:      Tiny solitary intramedullary cervical cord lesion to the left of midline anterolaterally at C2, demonstrating signal characteristics typical of cavernous malformation. Attempt will be made to have the patient recalled for gadolinium enhanced MRI of the cervical spine to exclude the low likelihood of enhancement.      Large left paracentral and medial foraminal disc protrusion at C5-6 severely narrows the left lateral recess and neural foramina, and may compress the exiting left C6 nerve root.",0

,"FINDINGS: Spine radiographs from 30 November, 2017 reviewed. The lumbar spine CT from 5 March, 2013 was also reviewed. Â Overall alignment of the lumbar spine is normal. Some lumbar spine straightening may simply be positional. Vertebral body heights are maintained allowing for chronic mild anterior compression fracture of L3. Vertebral body height maintained posteriorly. The conus terminates normally at the superior endplate of L1. Paraspinal soft tissues unremarkable. Â T11 / T12 shows only minimal degenerative disc disease and no spinal colectomy or exit neural foraminal stenosis. Â T12 / L1 shows worsening disc desiccation and annular disc ballooning but no spinal stenosis or exit neural foraminal stenosis. Â L1 / L2 through L3 / L4 are all essentially unremarkable with no significant spinal stenosis or exit neural foraminal stenosis. Â At L4 / L5 there is disc desiccation and a broad - based midline disc extrusion which effaces the thecal sac anteriorly. This is an AP thickness of about 4 to 5 mm and extends caudally about 7 mm on the posterior margin of the L5 vertebral body. This moderate facet osteoarthritis on the left with some ligamentum flavum hypertrophy. These findings in combination produce a moderate exit neural foraminal stenosis on the left. Possible irritation of the transiting L5 nerve root in the lateral recess. Only mild neural foraminal narrowing on the left. Â At L5 / S1 there is some broad - based posterior disc bulging with a small right paracentral disc protrusion. This causes no spinal stenosis or exit neural foraminal stenosis, but could conceivably be annoys the transiting S1 nerve root in the tibial_plateau recess positionally. Â SUMMARY: Â Multilevel degenerative disc Sleeping_sickness as described. Â Disc extrusion at L4 / L5 in combination with left facet hypertrophy and ligamentum flavum thickening produces a mild exit neural foraminal coronary_artery and possible lateral recess stenosis on the left. Å_¢_â_¬ At #.#E / S1 there may be irritation of the transiting S1 nerve root in the lateral recess secondary to a small right paracentral disc protrusion",1

483.0,"Technical:      Sagittal T1, sagittal T2, axial T2, and axial 3-D MEDIC sequences were performed.      FINDINGS:      Reversal of the normal cervical lordosis is present centered at the C4/5 level. Fairly advanced vertebral body height loss is present at the C4 level along with moderate vertebral body height loss at the C3 and C5 levels and mild vertebral body height loss at the C6 level, all of which appear chronic. Otherwise, to the extent visualized, the vertebral body heights are well-maintained. Mild degenerative change is present involving the predental space. Small anterior osteophytes are present extending from the C3/4 level superiorly down through the C6/7 level inferiorly. The cerebellar tonsils appear normal with respect to position.      At the C2/3 level, the intervertebral disc is unremarkable. The neural foramina appear patent.      At the C3/4 level, fairly prominent degenerative endplate changes are present. Degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints which results in an anterolisthesis of the body of C3 with respect to the body of C4 which measures approximately 5 to 6 mm with associated uncovering of the posterior aspect of the intervertebral disc. Disc/osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline which along with hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum results in mild compression of the adjacent thecal sac/spinal cord. Subtle focal abnormal increased T2 signal is present within the adjacent spinal cord compatible with edematous change. Degenerative change is present involving the uncovertebral joint bilaterally. The findings are resulting in fairly advanced neural foraminal compromise bilaterally.      At the C4/5 level, degenerative endplate changes are present along with moderate narrowing of the intervertebral disc. Degenerative change is present involving the facet joints which results in an anterolisthesis of the body of C4 with respect to the body of C5 measuring approximately 3 mm with associated uncovering of the posterior aspect of the intervertebral disc. A tiny disc protrusion is present posteriorly, straddling the midline but slightly more prominent to the left of midline, which appears to abut but not significantly compress the ventral surface of the adjacent spinal cord. Degenerative changes are present involving the uncovertebral joint bilaterally. The findings are resulting in moderate compromise of the left neural foramen and mild compromise of the right neural foramen.      At the C5/6 level, degenerative endplate changes are present along with moderate to advanced narrowing of the intervertebral disc. A small amount of vacuum phenomenon is suspected within the intervertebral disc. Degenerative change is present involving the facet joints which appears to result in a subtle retrolisthesis of the body of C5 with respect to the body of C6 which measures approximately 2 mm. Disc/osteophyte complex is present posteriorly, straddling the midline, which narrows the ventral subarachnoid space. Degenerative change is present involving the uncovertebral joint bilaterally, more prominent on the right side. The findings are resulting in severe compromise of the right neural foramen and at least moderate compromise of the left neural foramen.      At the C6/7 level, degenerative endplate changes are present along with moderate-to-advanced narrowing of the intervertebral disc. Mild disc/osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline, which narrows the ventral subarachnoid space. Degenerative changes are present involving the uncovertebral and facet joints bilaterally, more prominent on the right side. The findings are resulting in moderate compromise of the right neural foramen and mild compromise of the left neural foramen.      At the C7/T1 level, subtle degenerative endplate changes are present. Mild degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints. The findings are resulting in minimal compromise of the left neural foramen. The right neural foramen is patent.      The remainder of the visualized levels are unremarkable.      To the extent visualized, the soft tissues of the neck are unremarkable. Patchy abnormal increased T2 signal is present centrally within the pons which is nonspecific but may simply reflect small-vessel ischemic changes, especially if the patient has a history of hypertension and/or diabetes.      IMPRESSION:      Vertebral body height loss is present at the C3, C4, C5, and C6 levels, with associated kyphotic deformity. Superimposed degenerative change is present involving the intervertebral disc as well as the uncovertebral and facet joints, resulting in neural foraminal compromise at multiple levels (most striking bilaterally at the C3/4 level) as well as at least mild compression of the thecal sac/spinal cord at the C3/4 level as discussed. Additionally, subtle focal abnormal increased T2 signal is present within the spinal cord at the C3/4 level compatible with edematous change. A fairly urgent surgical consultation is advised.",1

654.0,"History:  Lower back pain, radicular symptoms. Has lower legs pain, numbness some  weakness.  Technique:  Standard protocol for lumbar spine.  Findings:  Assuming 5 lumbar vertebrae, normal conus medullaris terminates in L1.  Bone marrow signal and vertebral body height are normal.  Her congenitally short pedicles do predispose to central stenosis.  Variable (mild to moderate) disc degeneration is present in all levels between L2 and  S1.  No significant abnormality is seen above L2. There is no neural compromise.  In L2-3, a broad posterior disc bulge slightly indents the ventral thecal sac but does not  cause neural compromise. Facet joints are normal.  In L3-4, severe bilateral facet OA has resulted in mild (grade 1 or less) anterolisthesis.  The anterolisthesis, her congenitally smaller canal, hypertrophic change from facet joint  and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy all result in moderate/severe central stenosis  whereby the central canal is reduced to a sagittal dimension of barely 5 mm, appearing  to completely efface subarachnoid space at the disc level.  MRI LUMBAR SPINE  There is concurrent severe bilateral lateral recess, which could also compromise  bilateral descending L4 nerves where they exit the thecal sac. Bilateral neuroforamina  remain patent.  In L4-5, severe bilateral facet OA is associated with mild grade 1 degenerative  anterolisthesis. Similar to L3-4 above, constellation of findings result in mild central  stenosis. However, central canal is probably still adequate in this level, with some  preserved subarachnoid space. Neural foramina are patent.  In L5 1, there is severe bilateral facet OA without spondylolisthesis. The disc is actually  normal, and no neural compromise is seen in this level.  Impression:  A constellation of degenerative changes result in severe central stenosis in L3-4 along  with severe stenosis of the bilateral lateral recess. Clinical correlation is required  regarding cauda equina syndrome or L4 radiculopathy.  Mild central stenosis in L4-5 is due to the same Constellation of pathologies. However,  no convincing neural compromise is seen in this level.  There is severe bilateral facet OA in all levels from L3-4 to L5-S1.",0

An exaggeration of the thoracic kyphosis centered at T8/9 is also similar to the prior CT study.  There is otherwise normal alignment of the vertebral bodies and facet joints.     On the localizer images, prominent T2 hyperintensity within the L5 vertebral body may relate to an underlying hemangioma.

There is mild dextroconvex lumbar curvature.  Vertebral body heights are maintained.  Minimal retrolisthesis of L1 on L2 by 0.3 cm is similar to previous.  No further malalignment is seen.  There is disc desiccation throughout the lower thoracic and lumbar spine with disc space narrowing from L2 to S1 and vacuum phenomenon at a few levels.  There is endplate spurring/osteophytosis at most levels in the lower thoracic and lumbar spine most pronounced on the left at L2-L3 with endplate irregularity and Modic changes greatest from L2 to S1.  A degree of interspinous impingement is present in the lower lumbar spine.  There is a developmentally narrow lumbar spinal canal due to short pedicles.  The conus medullaris is normally positioned at the L1 level.  There is a small central disc protrusion which focally indents the ventral aspect of the thecal sac at T11-T12 and a small right foraminal disc protrusion at T12-L1.

Schmorl's node in the inferior endplate of L1.  Mild left neural foraminal narrowing.  No significant canal, lateral recess or right neural foraminal narrowing.  At L2-L3: Diffuse disc bulge and disc osteophyte complex asymmetrically larger on the left which indent the ventral aspect of the thecal sac.  Together with mild facet and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy, this results in moderate left and mild right neural foraminal narrowing.  No significant canal or lateral recess narrowing.  At L3-L4: Diffuse disc bulge and disc osteophyte complex asymmetrically larger on the left with superimposed small left paracentral disc protrusion which indent the ventral aspect of the thecal sac.  Together with ligamentum flavum thickening and mild to moderate facet degenerative change, this results in mild right and mild to moderate left neural foraminal narrowing and slight narrowing of the left lateral recess.

At L4-L5: Diffuse disc bulge and disc osteophyte complex with superimposed small right paracentral disc protrusion which indent the ventral aspect of the thecal sac.  Together with ligamentum flavum thickening and moderate to advanced facet degenerative change, this results in severe canal narrowing with effacement of the periradicular CSF, central crowding of the cauda equina nerve roots and reduced AP diameter of the thecal sac which measures 0.5 to 0.6 cm.  There is moderate narrowing of the right lateral recess with the transiting right L5 nerve root interposed between the facet and disc material and moderate left and mild-to-moderate right neural foraminal narrowing.  No significant left lateral recess narrowing.

No fractures are identified.  There is sclerosis within the inferior endplate of the L4 vertebral body consistent with degenerative changes.  Small to moderate-sized anterior lumbar vertebral osteophytes are noted throughout the lumbar spine.  There are congenitally short lumbar pedicles.      The conus medullaris lies at L1.  The cauda equina return normal signal.      Discs -   L1-2 - mild disc degeneration with mild loss of disc height and a trivial circumferential disc bulge most predominantly anteriorly.  No evidence of spinal canal stenosis.  There is moderate narrowing of the right L1-2 neural foramen with possible minor impingement on the exiting right L1 nerve root.

,"MR LUMBAR SPINE Reason for Exam: POST MVA SEVERE ANTICIPATION WITH BILATERAL HIP RADIATION. ? HERNIATED DISC TECHNIQUE: Sagittal T1 and sagittal T2 - weighted imaging of the lumbar spine was performed. Sagittal T2 weighted imaging of the thoracic spine was also performed. Axial T1 / T2 - weighted imaging was also performed from the level of L3 - S1 and from T9 - T11 with dedicated axial T2 - weighted imaging from T6 / 7 to T11. FINDINGS: MRI THORACIC SPINE: Fast_MOBILE Schmorl ' s nodes are noted at T8 with mild anterior wedging of the T8 vertebral body which may relate to previous trauma. Minor anterior wedging of the T9 vertebral body is also noted. Tiny T2 hyperintensities within whenthe T8 and T10 vertebral bodies may relate to underlying hemangiomas or fatty rests. There is otherwise normal alignment of the vertebral bodies and facet joints with no significant loss in vertebral body height. At T9 / 10, a large KISSology extrusion is noted within the left subarticular region extending into the left lateral and posterior aspect of the epidural space. A small disc component is also noted within the right subarticular region. The thoracic spinal cord is being displaced to the right and is being compressed with abnormal T2 hyperintense DPSK within the thoracic spinal cord at the level of T9 / 10 compatible with cord edema / myelomalacia. More subtle abnormal T2 hyperintense frequency_modulated is suspected superiorly to the level of T7 and inferiorly to the level of T11. Mild to moderate left neural foraminal narrow is also noted. At T10 / 11, a moderate left subarticular disc extrusion isn_`_ta noted minimally extending superiorly and extending posteriorly along the left lateral epidural space contacting the left lateral aspect of the thoracic spinal cord with no significant spinal canal narrowing.

742.0,"COMPARISON: Lumbar spine x-rays from April 21, 2020, and MRI of the lumbar spine from June 17,  2014.  TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar multisequential MRI of the lumbar spine was performed pre and post  administration of intravenous gadolinium contrast.  FINDINGS: Mild dextroconvex scoliosis of the lumbar spine. Minimal anterolisthesis of L3 over L4. The  conus medullaris terminates at T12-L1. Moderate-to-severe degenerative disc disease at L2-L3, overall  worsened when compared to prior more remote MRI. Mild degenerative disc disease of the remainder of  the lumbar spine, most severe at L3-L4.  Modic type 2 and type 3 changes at L2-L3. Modic type 2 changes also noted at L3-L4. Small T2  hyperintense lesion within the T10 vertebral body is partially imaged measuring 7 mm, favored to be  related to an area of fatty marrow or small hemangioma rather than other etiologies.  Sagittal imaging from the inferior T10 until L1 demonstrates a small posterior disc protrusion at T11-T12  without significant central canal stenosis or foraminal stenosis appreciated at these levels on sagittal  images.  Findings related to prior laminectomy from L2 until L5-S1, similar to previous. Mild hyperenhancement is  noted within the subcutaneous soft tissues in the paraspinal region, extending from inferior L1 until S1,  favored to be related to postsurgical scarring with likely also a small amount of subcutaneous soft tissue edema noted within this region.  Questionable faint area of increased enhancement posterior to the L2-L3 vertebral body level and along  the posterior aspect of the L2-L3 vertebral body level, could be related to postsurgical  changes/postsurgical scarring, although considered less likely findings related to discitis cannot be  completely excluded. No significant bone marrow edema is appreciated within this region at L2-L3 on STIR  imaging.  Axial images were obtained from L1 until S1. On a level by level basis:  L1-L2: Mild bilateral facet arthropathy and minimal circumferential disc bulge. No significant central canal  stenosis. Minimal left foraminal narrowing. No significant right foraminal narrowing.  L2-L3: Circumferential disc bulge with a left paracentral disc protrusion measuring 1.1 x 0.8 x 1.0 cm,  with likely also a small annular tear noted within this region measuring 4 mm. Indentation on the left  lateral recess, likely impinging the left L3 nerve root. Moderate central canal stenosis at this level, which  appears marginally worsened when compared to previous. Moderate bilateral facet arthropathy, left  worse than right. Severe left foraminal stenosis. Moderate right foraminal stenosis. The degree of  foraminal stenosis at this level is similar to previous.  L3-L4: Circumferential disc bulge and moderate bilateral facet arthropathy. Mild central canal stenosis,  similar to previous. Mild-moderate bilateral foraminal stenosis, left slightly worse than right and mildly  worsened when compared to previous.  Small probable annular tear noted centrally measuring 3 mm.  L4-L5: Circumferential disc bulge with moderate bilateral facet arthropathy. Minimal central canal  narrowing with indentation on the right lateral recess, which could cause irritation of the right L5 nerve  root, overall similar in appearance when compared to previous. Moderate right and mild left foraminal  stenosis, similar to previous.  L5-S1: Moderate-to-severe bilateral facet arthropathy. No significant central canal stenosis. No significant  foraminal stenosis.  IMPRESSION:  1. Prior laminectomy from L2 until L5-S1. Findings likely related to postsurgical scarring and subcutaneous  soft tissue edema within the posterior paraspinal subcutaneous soft tissues. Questionable minimal  hyperenhancement along the posterior L2-L3 disc space and extending posterior to the L2-L3 disc space,  favored to be related to postsurgical scarring in this region, although considered less likely focal discitis  cannot be completely excluded; no significant bone marrow edema is appreciated at this level. For clinical  correlation.   2. Moderate-to-severe spondylotic changes as described above and most severe at L2-L3 where there is  moderate-to-severe degenerative disc disease, which has significantly worsened when compared to prior  more remote MRI, although similar in appearance when compared to more recent prior lumbar spine  x-rays. Circumferential disc bulge with superimposed disc protrusion at L2-L3 resulting in indentation of  the left lateral recess, which could cause irritation of the left L3 nerve root and with moderate central  canal stenosis at this level, which appears marginally worsened when compared to previous, as well as  severe left and moderate right foraminal stenosis at this level, which is similar to previous.

Compared with plain film from October 3, 2018     TECHNIQUE:     Sagittal T1, T2 and axial medic sequences.     FINDINGS:     There is loss of the normal cervical lordosis. Minor degenerative height loss involving the superior endplate of C6. Cervical vertebral body heights and alignment are otherwise preserved. The cervical spinal cord is normal in signal.           At C2-3, moderate right facet degenerative changes demonstrated with mild right foraminal stenosis.     At C3-4, broad-based disc osteophyte complex indents the ventral thecal sac with small amount of CSF surrounding the cord. Right more than left facet and bilateral uncovertebral degenerative change causes right more than left foraminal stenosis.     At C4-5, broad-based disc osteophyte complex indents the ventral thecal sac and abuts the ventral cord effacing the ventral and dorsal CSF suggesting mild spinal canal stenosis. Uncovertebral degenerative changes are demonstrated left slightly more than right causing mild left more than right foraminal stenosis.     At C5-6, broad-based disc osteophyte complex effaces the ventral and dorsal CSF and abuts the ventral cord causing mild contouring of the ventral cord suggesting mild to moderate acquired spinal canal stenosis. Uncovertebral degenerative changes cause bilateral foraminal stenosis. This is noted greater on the left side.     At C6-7 right eccentric disc osteophyte complex effaces the ventral and dorsal CSF and minorly contours the right ventral cord suggesting mild spinal canal stenosis. Uncovertebral degenerative changes are present bilaterally subtly greater on the right causing right greater than left foraminal stenosis.     At C7-T1, there is right paracentral and medial foraminal disc protrusion which may cause some compression on the exiting right C8 nerve root. No spinal or left foraminal stenosis.     IMPRESSION:     Small right paracentral and medial foraminal disc protrusion at C7-T1 which may affect the exiting right C8 nerve root possibly accounting for the patient's symptoms.     Mild spinal canal stenosis primarily at C5-6 and to a lesser degree at C4-5 and C6-7. No cervical cord signal change is demonstrated.",0

548.0,Findings:       5 lumbar-type vertebral bodies are present over the examination. The tip of the conus terminates at the T12-L1 disc space.       There is grade 1 anterolisthesis of L5 on S1. There is retrolisthesis of L2 on L3 and L1 on L2.          T11-12: There is a mild posterior disc bulge. There is no central canal stenosis. The bilateral neural foramen remain patent.    T12-L1: Normal    L1-2: Grade 1 retrolisthesis. There is no central canal stenosis or neuroforaminal narrowing.    L2-3: There is grade 1 retrolisthesis of L2 on L3. There are mild degenerative endplate changes. There is a posterior disc bulge   which impinges on the thecal sac and results in right lateral recess narrowing. This likely results in impingement of the   transiting L5 nerve root. There is moderate right neuroforaminal narrowing.    L3-4: The facet joints are within normal limits. There is mild right neural foraminal narrowing.    L4-5: There is moderate bilateral neural foraminal narrowing. There is no significant disc bulge.       At the level of the mid L5 vertebral body there is moderate central canal stenosis where the majority of the CSF is excluded from  the canal. This is largely due to combination of facet hypertrophy and epidural fat.       L5-S1: There are bilateral pars defects at L5 resulting in grade 1 anterolisthesis. There is no central canal stenosis. There is   moderate right neural foraminal narrowing and severe left neural foraminal narrowing.       Impression:       Moderate central canal stenosis at the level of the mid L5 vertebral body. This is likely due to epidural fat along the posterior  aspect of the L5 vertebral body and bilateral L5 pars defects.       Bilateral pars defects at L5 resulting in grade 1 anterolisthesis.       Severe left neuroforaminal narrowing at L5-S1.       Posterior disc bulge at L2-3 resulting in right lateral recess narrowing.

32.0,"TECHNIQUE: Routine, noncontrast MRI sequences have been acquired. These  include sagittal T1, T2 and STIR sequences from the base of the skull to the bottom of  T4 and axial T2 sequences from C2 to T2 and axial T2 3-D medic from C2-C3 to C7-  T1.  COMPARISON STUDY:No prior cross-sectional imaging for comparison. Reference  has been made to x-rays from May 2, 2018.  FINDINGS:  There is straightening of normal cervical lordosis. The vertebral body heights appear  preserved and bone marrow signal appears within physiologic normal limits, to the  extent visualized.  At C2-C3 and C3-C4, there is disc desiccation without loss of disc height. The central  canal and neural foramina appear widely patent.  At C4-C5, there is disc desiccation and moderate to severe loss of disc height. Small  marginal osteophytes are present anteriorly. Posteriorly, there is a broad-based disc  osteophyte complex that mildly indents the ventral thecal sac and is associated with  subtle cord contouring posterior central regions; no convincing cord signal alteration.  There are posterior lateral disc osteophyte complexes, right larger than left. There is  associated moderate narrowing of the right neural foramen and mild narrowing of the  left neural foramen.    C5-C6: Disc desiccation and fairly severe loss of disc height. Broad-based posterior  disc osteophyte complex is present and most pronounced in the posterior central and  right paracentral region where there is associated cord contouring without convincing cord signal abnormality. There are small posterior lateral disc osteophyte complexes  that mildly narrow both neural foramina.  C6-C7: There is disc desiccation and moderate loss of disc height. There is a  somewhat ill-defined T2 intermediate predominant signal disc protrusion right posterior  paracentral region and extending to involve the proximal aspect of the neural foramen.  Subtle focal cord contouring present in the right paracentral region. No convincing  associated cord signal alteration. CSF appears maintained ventral to the cord more  leftward. Tiny posterior lateral disc osteophyte complex on the left. Moderate  narrowing of the right neural foramen and minor narrowing of the left neural foramen.  C7-T1: There is disc desiccation and mild loss of disc height. No focal disc osteophyte  complex. Central canal and neural foramina appear widely patent.  T1-T2: Unremarkable.  Paraspinal musculature appears reasonably maintained and symmetric.    IMPRESSION:  1. Multilevel cervical degenerative disc change, particularly at C4-C5, C5-C6 and  C6-C7 where right sided predominant paracentral disc osteophyte complexes are  associated with mild contouring of the ventral cord without convincing cord signal  alteration/myelomalacia. Subtle areas of apparent increased T2 signal within the  cord on the sagittal sequence or not confidently seen on the axial images and are  felt to most likely be artifactual.  2. Right posterior paracentral disc protrusion at C6-C7 extends to moderately  narrow the right neural foramen and may be further contributing to right C7 nerve  irritation.",0

Axial T1- and T2 weighted images were obtained through the lumbar spine.     FINDINGS:  The most inferior disc space is labelled L5-S1.  The conus terminates posterior to the inferior endplate of T12.  Visualized cord signal is normal.     Lower Thoracic spine: There is a Schmorl's node along the superior endplate of T12. No central canal stenosis or foraminal stenosis in the regional T-spine.     L1-2: Disc desiccation with loss of disc height. Mild diffuse annular disc bulge, extending laterally into the inferior aspect of the neural foramina. Associated anterior marginal osteophyte formation. Schmorl's node seen along the superior endplate of L2 anteriorly. No significant central canal stenosis or foraminal stenosis.     L2-3: Disc desiccation with mild disc bulge and some flattening of the anterior aspect of the thecal sac. Minimal extension of bulging disc material into the inferior aspect of the neural foramina bilaterally. Mild ligamentous thickening and facet hypertrophy with no significant central canal stenosis or foraminal stenosis.     L3-4: Mild central canal narrowing secondary to diffuse annular disc bulge, ligamentous thickening and facet hypertrophy. There is crowding of the traversing nerve roots bilaterally, worse on the right. Some encroachment of facet degenerative change on the neural foramina bilaterally. No direct impingement of the exiting nerve roots.     L4-5: Significant central canal narrowing secondary to diffuse annular disc bulge, ligamentous thickening and facet hypertrophy. The disc is eccentric to the right with effacement of the right lateral recess and significant crowding of the traversing nerve roots bilaterally, worse on the right. No impingement of the exiting nerve roots.     L5-S1: Near complete loss of disc height with endplate degenerative change and marginal osteophyte formation. The bulging disc material is minimally abutting the traversing S1 root without obvious displacement of the root. The thecal sac is narrowed secondary to prominent epidural fat.     OTHER: T2 bright foci seen in the kidneys bilaterally, most in keeping with incidental renal cysts.     OPINION:  Multilevel degenerative disc disease with associated spondylotic change. This is most marked in the lower lumbar spine.     Central canal stenosis is seen primarily at the L4-5 vertebral level where there is marked crowding of the traversing nerve roots, particularly on the right, and impingement of the traversing roots is suspected.
