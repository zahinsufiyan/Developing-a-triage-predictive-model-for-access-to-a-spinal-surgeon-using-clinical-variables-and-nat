WAIT_FOR: Sagittal and axial T1 and T2 - weighted sequences were performed. FINDINGS: This report assumes five lumbar - type vertebrae. A curvature is present convex to the right which may in part be related to patient positioning. The vertebral body heights are well maintained. The bone marrow signal is fairly homogeneous allowing for hemangiomata / fatty rests as well as degenerative endplate changes. The conus medullaris terminates normally at approximately the L1 level. At the S1 / 2 level, an underdeveloped disc is noted. No significant neural foraminal compromise or compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated. At the L5 / S1 level, at least moderate degenerative medially changes are present along with moderate - to - advanced narrowing of the intervertebral deluxe_edition. A small amount of vacuum phenomenon is suspected within the intervertebral disc. Mild disc / osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline, which extends laterally protruding into the detriment aspect of the neural foramen bilaterally. The posterior disc / osteophyte complex believed to abut but not significantly displace or compress the traversing S1 nerve root bilaterally.

464.0,"HISTORY: Chronic pain, lumbar spine.  COMPARISON: CT, 2014.  FINDINGS: The vertebral height of the lumbar spine is preserved. There is T1-T2 hyperintensity in the  subchondral region of L5 and S1 vertebral body, likely secondary to Modic type II degenerative endplate  change. There is T2 and T1 hypointensity in the L4 vertebral body, likely secondary to Modic type III  degenerative endplate change. Conus medullaris is normally situated. No suspicious focal bony lesion  identified. The visualized extraspinal structures are unremarkable. There is multilevel facet OA. The patient  is probably status post laminectomy in the right S1 level.  From T12 to L4 level, no significant degenerative disc disease. Central canal is patent. No significant  neural foramen stenosis.  L4-L5: There is mild retrolisthesis with uncovering of disc. There is mild indentation of anterior thecal sac.  No significant central canal stenosis. There is bilateral mild to moderate neural foramen stenosis. There is moderate disc desiccation and disc space narrowing. After injection with Gadolinium, there is a small  amount of peripheral enhancement in anterior aspect of the disc space. However, no MRI evidence of  significant fluid signal is demonstrated in this region. Finding probably represents sequelae of chronic  degenerative disc disease. No drainable fluid collection demonstrated.  L5-S1: There is moderate to severe disc space narrowing with endplate irregularity, most likely secondary  to chronic chronic degenerative disc disease. No significant central canal or neural foramen stenosis. Right  laminectomy is noted.  IMPRESSION:  Multilevel degenerative disc disease, facet OA in the lower lumbar spine. The degenerative disc disease at  the L4-L5 level appears to be progressed since the previous CT study of 2014.  Bilateral mild to moderate neural foramen stenosis at L4-L5 level. Allowing for different technique, there is probably no significant adverse change since 2014.",0
846.0,"FINDINGS: Spine radiographs from 30 November, 2017 reviewed.  The lumbar spine CT from 5 March, 2013 was also reviewed.  Â   Overall alignment of the lumbar spine is normal.  Some lumbar spine straightening may simply be positional.  Vertebral body heights are maintained allowing for chronic mild anterior compression fracture of L3.  Vertebral body height maintained posteriorly.  The conus terminates normally at the superior endplate of L1.  Paraspinal soft tissues unremarkable.  Â   T11/T12 shows only minimal degenerative disc disease and no spinal stenosis or exit neural foraminal stenosis.  Â   T12/L1 shows worsening disc desiccation and annular disc bulging but no spinal stenosis or exit neural foraminal stenosis.  Â   L1/L2 through L3/L4 are all essentially unremarkable with no significant spinal stenosis or exit neural foraminal stenosis.  Â   At L4/L5 there is disc desiccation and a broad-based midline disc extrusion which effaces the thecal sac anteriorly.  This is an AP thickness of about 4 to 5 mm and extends caudally about 7 mm along the posterior margin of the L5 vertebral body.  This moderate facet osteoarthritis on the left with some ligamentum flavum hypertrophy.  These findings in combination produce a moderate exit neural foraminal stenosis on the left.  Possible irritation of the transiting L5 nerve root in the lateral recess.  Only mild neural foraminal narrowing on the left.  Â   At L5/S1 there is some broad-based posterior disc bulging with a small right paracentral disc protrusion.  This causes no spinal stenosis or exit neural foraminal stenosis, but could conceivably be irritating the transiting S1 nerve root in the lateral recess positionally.  Â   SUMMARY:  Â   Multilevel degenerative disc disease as described.  Â   Disc extrusion at L4/L5 in combination with left facet hypertrophy and ligamentum flavum thickening produces a moderate exit neural foraminal stenosis and possible lateral recess stenosis on the left.  Â   At L5/S1 there may be irritation of the transiting S1 nerve root in the lateral recess secondary to a small right paracentral disc protrusion",1

454.0,"CLINICAL HISTORY: Increased lumbar spine pain. Tenderness and low range of motion. Note is made of recent nuclear medicine white cell scan performed for rule out septic joints with multifocal musculoskeletal pain and increased CRP.     COMPARISON: Nuclear medicine white cell scan completed earlier today, MRI lumbar spine December 29, 2012, radiographs of the lumbar spine August 1, 2018     TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar multi with MRI of the entire spine with and without gadolinium     FINDINGS:  There are 7 cervical, 12 thoracic, and 5 lumbar type vertebra. Conus medullaris is not optimally seen, but appears to terminate around the L1 level.     Mild reversal cervical lordosis and mild anterolisthesis of C3 on C4, favored to be chronic. Moderate left convex curvature of the lumbar spine centered at L4 due to height loss in the right side of the L4 vertebra appears unchanged from April 6, 2020, mildly increased from August 1, 2018. Grade 1 anterolisthesis of L5 on S1 is also unchanged and is associated with bilateral pars intra-articular is defects and severe facet arthropathy on CT.     Cervical:  Marrow signal is diffusely decreased. There is subtle STIR hyperintensity and minor enhancement within the C3-C6 vertebra, with multilevel associated degenerative change. Multiple small disc osteophyte formations are seen in the cervical spine, with no significant spinal canal stenosis. Cervical neural foramina are not well assessed on this study due to technique.     Small (2.1 x 2.7 mm) cystic-appearing focus within the paraspinal musculature to the left of midline the C7-T1 level is nonenhancing and incompletely visualized, presumably just a small incidental cyst. No surrounding enhancement or edema. Visualized posterior fossa structures, cervical spinal cord, and other paraspinal soft tissues are grossly unremarkable.     Thoracic:  No osseous edema or abnormal osseous enhancement in the thoracic spine. No significant spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis is identified in the thoracic region the thoracic spinal cord appears normal in caliber and signal intensity within the limits of this study.      Limited assessment of the thoracic paraspinal soft tissues demonstrates no other significant abnormalities.     Lumbar:  Modic type II degenerative endplate signal change without significant enhancement at the L2-3 level. Mild edema and enhancement of the endplates on either side of the L3-4 disc space. Prominent Schmorl's nodes suspected in the superior endplate of L4. Modic type II degenerative endplate signal change without significant enhancement or edema in the endplates about the L4-5 disc space. Mild edema and enhancement slight endplate irregularity about the L5-S1 disc space. Severe multilevel arthropathy with most prominently on the right at L3-4 through L5-S1 where there is mild osseous edema and enhancement. This most conspicuously involves the right L3-4 facet with some loss of cortex in either side of the joint. There is prominent edema and enhancement within the paraspinal muscles adjacent to these facets. Minimal fluid within the L1-2 through L5-S1 disc spaces.     At T12-L1 and L1-2: Small posterior disc bulges without significant spinal canal stenosis.     At L2-3: Small posterior disc bulge in combination with hypertrophic facet arthropathy mildly narrows the spinal canal. Moderate left and mild right neural foraminal narrowing secondary to facet arthropathy.     At L3-4: Small broad disc bulge and endplate osteophyte and combination with severe right more than left hypertrophic facet arthropathy moderately narrows the central portion the spinal canal. Further enhancing tissue presumably extending from the adjacent facet joint effaces the right neural foramina and subarticular recess, which are both significantly narrow potentially causing impingement upon the right L3 and L4 nerve roots respectively. Moderate to severe left neural foraminal narrowing.     At L4-5: Small broad disc bulge and marked hypertrophic facet arthropathy, narrowing the left more than right subarticular recess but not significantly narrowing the central portion the spinal canal. Severe left and moderate to severe right neural foraminal narrowing secondary to the facet arthropathy. There could also be some distortion of the left L5 nerve root within the subarticular recess.     At L5-S1: Grade 1 anterolisthesis associated bilateral pars interarticularis defects and severe facet arthropathy. There is only mild narrowing of the spinal canal. Severe bilateral neural foraminal narrowing secondary to the facet arthropathy and listhesis.     Limited assessment of the visualized paraspinal soft tissues demonstrates no additional significant abnormalities.     IMPRESSION:  1.  Complex study revealing no convincing single focal source of infection arising from the spine. Advanced degenerative change in the lumbar spine. Mild enhancement within the C3-C6 vertebra, within the endplates on either side of the L1-2, L3-4, and L5-S1 disc spaces, and in the right L3-4 through L5-S1 facets could largely reflect changes of active arthropathy. However, a low-grade or multifocal infection particularly at the lumbar sites of enhancement would be difficult to exclude on MRI. The most prominent finding is cortical irregularity and significant adjacent soft tissue and epidural enhancement surrounding the right L3-4 facet joint, which could reflect infection but is of less certain significance given extent of findings elsewhere.     2.  Multilevel degenerative change in the lumbar spine as detailed. As described there potential nerve root impingement in the spinal canal at L3-4 and in the neural foramina at L3-4 through L5-S1.     3.

Combined disc osseous complex encroach on the central canal with encroachment on the adjacent spinal cord.  Unfortunately signal intensity is not optimal at this level but there is some degree of flattening of the cervical spinal cord.  No obvious myelomalacia.     There is minor compression fracture involving the superior endplates of T4 with no associated marrow edema likely long-standing.  There is fusion anteriorly at the T10-T11 level with a rudimentary disc interspace posteriorly.  The alignment of the posterior margins the vertebral bodies is maintained.

A subtle curvature is present convex to the left which may simply be related to patient positioning. The vertebral body heights are well maintained. The bone marrow signal is fairly homogeneous, allowing for hemangiomata/fatty rests as well as relatively mild degenerative endplate changes at several levels. The conus medullaris terminates normally at approximately the level of the T12/L1 intervertebral disc.     At the S1-S2 level, an underdeveloped disc is noted. No significant neural foraminal compromise or compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.     At the L5-S1 level, subtle degenerative endplate changes are present. Minor degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints. No significant neural foraminal compromise or compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.     At the L4-L5 level, mild degenerative endplate changes are present along with at least mild narrowing of the intervertebral disc. Mild circumferential disc bulging is present and relatively mild disc-osteophyte complex is identified laterally protruding into the region of the neural foramen bilaterally, more prominent on the left side. A superimposed tiny disc protrusion/extrusion is present posteriorly to the left of midline which appears to contact the undersurface of the exiting left L4 nerve root and may contact the traversing left L5 nerve root. Degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints, mild on the left and minimal on the right. The findings are resulting in moderate compromise of the left neural foramen and minimal compromise of the right neural foramen. No significant compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.     At the L3-L4 level, subtle degenerative endplate changes and narrowing of the intervertebral disc are present. Minor disc-osteophyte complex is suspected laterally protruding into the region of the neural foramen bilaterally. Facet joints are unremarkable.

An exaggeration of the thoracic kyphosis centered at T8 / 9 is also similar to the prior CT study. There is otherwise normal alignment of the vertebral bodies and facet joints. On the taxiway images, prominent T2 hyperintensity within the L5 vertebral body may relate to an underlying hemangioma. Small superior Schmorl ' s nodes are also noted at L5 and S1.

Query spinal stenosis or radiculopathy.     TECHNIQUE: Sagittal and axial T1 and T2 sequences of the lumbar spine.     COMPARISON: Lumbar spine x-rays February 8, 2021 (MIC).     FINDINGS: 5 lumbar type vertebrae are identified.  Mild chronic-appearing anterior height loss of T12 is observed.  Remaining vertebral body heights are normal.  Sagittal alignment of the lumbar spine is within normal limits.  Minor Modic type II signal alteration is seen throughout the imaged lower thoracic and lumbar spine anteriorly.  Type II Modic signal alteration is more extensive at L5-S1.  Marrow signal is otherwise unremarkable.  The conus medullaris terminates at the L2-3 level, within the lower limits of normal.  The imaged spinal cord is unremarkable.     T11-12 and T12-L1: Mild disc height loss with focal posterior disc protrusions.  No facet arthropathy.  Mild T11-12 spinal canal stenosis, with patent spinal canal at T12-L1.  Exit foramina through these levels are patent.  L1-2: Mild disc height loss with a circumferential disc bulge and posterior annular fissure.  No substantial facet arthropathy.  Spinal canal and exit foramina are patent.  L2-3: Minimal disc height loss with a mild circumferential disc bulge slightly more prominent to the left posterior region with a posterior annular fissure.  Mild bilateral facet arthropathy.

There is mild inferior narrowing of the left exit foramen.  The right exit foramen is patent.  L3-4: Mild disc height loss is seen, with a circumferential disc bulge.  Superimposed on this is a prominent posterior central disc protrusion.  Moderate bilateral facet arthropathy with ligamenta flava buckling is present.  There is resultant moderately severe spinal canal stenosis, with AP caliber of the spinal canal reduced to 5 mm, causing obliteration of the subarachnoid space and crowding of the cauda equina fibers to the point where individual fibers are not discernible.  There is definite impingement of the bilateral traversing L4 nerve roots.  Abnormalities at this level also result in mild inferior bilateral exit foraminal stenosis.  L4-5: Disc height is maintained, with a mild circumferential disc bulge.  Moderately severe bilateral facet arthropathy with ligamenta flava buckling is noted.  The spinal canal is patent.  There is mild inferior narrowing of the bilateral exit foramina.  L5-S1: Severe disc height loss is identified, with a circumferential disc osteophyte complex eccentric to the left.  Mild to moderate bilateral facet arthropathy is identified.  The spinal canal is patent, but there is moderate left subarticular recess stenosis with suspected contact but not distortion of the traversing left S1 nerve root.  Mild right and moderate left exit foraminal stenosis are also detected.     SUMMARY:  1.  Multilevel disc and facet degeneration is present as detailed above.  2.  Disc bulge with posterior central disc protrusion at L3-4 results in moderately severe spinal canal stenosis.  3.  Disc and facet degeneration cause moderate left subarticular recess stenosis at L5-S1, with contact but not distortion of the traversing left S1 nerve root.  4.  Disc and facet degeneration cause left exit foraminal stenosis at L5-S1.

,"As noted before, there is evidence of the tethered cord and the spinal cord extends to the S1 level where it is tethered posteriorly. No evidence of any lipoma not Cavit_filings other abnormality in the spinal canal. The L1 - L2 disc space is slightly reduced and this is associated with a mild disc desiccation and a quite small posterior central annular tear which is causing a slight generalized disc bulge. This is a new finding. No evidence of disc protrusion. The ventral thecal sac is minimally kbps_MP3 but the spinal cord is normal. At L2 - L3, moderate aggravated_assault_NJSA_2C generalized degenerative Dolby_Digital_stereo bulge and disc desiccation are seen along with the slight reduction in the disc space. In addition, there is a mild to moderate size posterior - central and left parasagittal disc extrusion. The extruded disc measures 1. 2 cm in the transverse and 6 mm in AP dimensions. It extends slightly below was level of the disc space and is causing narrowing of the left lateral recess where the left L3 nerve root is impinged. The exiting bilateral L2 nerve roots are normal in the neural foramina. The descending right L3 nerve root is normal in the lateral recess. At L3 - 4, mild generalized degenerative disc bulge and disc desiccation are seen but the thecal sac, thoracic_spine canal and neural foramina are normal. The right L3 - 4 facet joint demonstrates a mild to moderate degree degenerative osteoarthritis where as the left facet joint is normal. At L4 - 5, there is a mild generalized at degenerative disc bulge and this is associated with a small posterior - central annular tear as well as a small broad - based disc protrusion. It is causing a slight bursal ventral thecal sac but the spinal canal and neural foramina are normal. There is no neurological compromise. A moderate degree hypertrophic degenerative osteoarthritis of the right facet joint is seen. At ligamentous - S1, a mild generalized at degenerative disc bulge and disc desiccation are seen. This is associated with a small posterior central annular tear but no evidence of disc protrusion and no evidence of neurological compromise at this level either. OPINION: 1. This patient has a developmental tethered cord and the spinal cord terminates at the S1 intensity where it is tethered posteriorly. 2. A moderate degree degenerative disc disease at L2 - L3 with associated mild to moderate size posterior central and left parasagittal disc extrusion which is causing compression of the descending left L3 nerve root in the lateral recess. This is a new finding. 3. A small posterior - central annular tear and a posterior - central disc protrusion at the L4 - L5 without any neurological compromise.

The visualized spinal cord demonstrates a normal appearance with no altered signal or evidence of syrinx. The conus is normally positioned at the L1 level. There is a marked S-shaped rotatory scoliosis noted convex to the right within the mid thoracic spine and convex to the left within the mid lumbar spine. Vertebral body marrow signal is unremarkable, other than degenerative endplate changes at the L2-3 level.     Within the thoracic spine, there is no focal disc bulge or protrusion identified. The spinal canal is widely patent. Neuroforamen are unremarkable in appearance with no evidence of exiting nerve root compromise.     L1-2: No disc bulge or protrusion.

L4-5: Mild broad-based disc osteophyte complex causing mild flattening of anterior thecal sac. There is also marked bilateral facet joint arthropathy left greater than right which contributes to moderate left-sided foraminal stenosis. The right-sided neural foramen is patent. Mild disc space narrowing. There is associated effacement of the left lateral recess with suspected compression of the traversing left L5 nerve root.     L5-S1: Broad-based disc osteophyte complex eccentric to the left causing minimal flattening of anterior thecal sac. This contributes to moderate left-sided foraminal stenosis and effacement of the left lateral recess with contact or mild compression of the traversing left S1 nerve root.

Vertebral body heights are maintained. Prevertebral soft tissues are unremarkable.  Â   Conus medullaris is normal, terminating at the L1 level. No fatty filum terminale.  Â   The T11-12 through L2-3 discs are normal. No spinal stenosis or neural foraminal stenosis at these levels.  Â   At L3-4, disc height is preserved. Minor peripheral hypointense T2 disc signal indicative of disc degeneration. Mild annular disc bulging but no nerve root impingement. No spinal stenosis or significant neural foraminal narrowing. Facet joints are unremarkable.  Â   At L4-5, mild loss of disc height is now evident, with similar diffuse hypointense T2 disc signal. There is unroofing of the posterior disc margin, with a small broad-based disc bulge indenting the ventral thecal sac. Small annular fissure at the left posterolateral margin of the disc. Moderately advanced bilateral facet degenerative changes with bilateral joint effusions and mild ligamentum flavum thickening. Combination of these findings results in mild stenoses of both lateral recesses and mild spinal stenosis. Slight narrowing of both neural foramina but no impingement of either exiting L4 nerve root. Appearances are unchanged from the prior MR study.  Â   There is a lobulated T1 hypointense focus demonstrating central hyperintense T2 signal and peripheral incomplete hypointense T2 rim situated at the anterolateral aspect of the left L4-5 facet joint, measuring 8 mm AP x 9 mm TR, consistent with a synovial cyst.

No evidence of any lipoma nor any other abnormality in the spinal canal.     The L1-L2 disc space is slightly reduced and this is associated with a mild disc desiccation and a quite small posterior central annular tear which is causing a slight generalized disc bulge.  This is a new finding.  No evidence of disc protrusion.  The ventral thecal sac is minimally compressed but the spinal cord is normal.     At L2-L3, moderate degree generalized degenerative disc bulge and disc desiccation are seen along with the slight reduction in the disc space.  In addition, there is a mild to moderate size posterior-central and left parasagittal disc extrusion.  The extruded disc measures 1.2 cm in the transverse and 6 mm in AP dimensions.  It extends slightly below the level of the disc space and is causing narrowing of the left lateral recess where the left L3 nerve root is impinged.

455.0,"TECHNIQUE: A routine lumbar spine protocol is performed.     FINDINGS:     The conus medullaris is appropriately situated at the T12-L1 level. No abnormality of signal or contour is identified within the distal cord or conus. Vertebral alignment is well maintained. Intervertebral disc spaces are well maintained. The intervertebral discs within the lower thoracic and upper lumbar spine as far distally as and including the L3-4 level, there is no disc bulge present. The spinal canal caliber is well maintained. Neural foramina are well maintained. There is no nerve root impingement. Facet joints are unremarkable.     At L4-5 level, there is mild decrease in T2 signal indicating early disc desiccation. There is a broad-based posterior disc protrusion which causes indentation upon the anterior aspect of the thecal sac. There is mild hypertrophy of ligamentum flavum at this level and these features produce mild spinal canal stenosis. In particular, there is some significant narrowing of the lateral recesses, more prominent on the left than on the right. This may cause some impingement upon the traversing L5 nerve roots. The disc bulge at this level produces some mild stenosis of the inferior aspects of the left neural foramen and some moderate stenosis of the right neural foramen in the absence of any nerve root impingement.     At the L5-S1 level, there is decreased T2 signal within the intervertebral disc indicating disc desiccation. There is a small broad-based posterior disc bulge which is slightly more prominent to the right of the midline. The disc bulge contains a tiny annular tear. The disc bulge does not cause any significant spinal stenosis. The neural foramina are mildly narrowed bilaterally in the absence of any direct nerve root impingement. There is some mild degenerative change within the facet joints.     CONCLUSION: There is disc degeneration at the L4-5 and L5-S1 levels. At the L4-5 level, disc bulge produces some narrowing of the spinal canal caliber and in particular, of the lateral recesses. There is potential for impingement upon the bilateral traversing L5 nerve roots. At the L5-S1 level, a small broad-based posterior disc bulge contains a tiny annular tear. There is mild degenerative change within the L5-S1 facet joints.     The Workers' Compensation Board has requested that we provide a professional opinion as to whether the imaging findings are related whole or in part to the injury in question.  This is not considered part of the official diagnostic imaging report, and will only be used to help a WCB caseworker decide whether the injury is work-related or not. My opinion is:     Some of the imaging findings could be related to the patient's injury.",0

,"Findings: Â Rainmaker_logo comparison is made with the prior lumbar MRI of 2017. Â Identification of the L5 segment is defined by the location of the iliolumbar ligament. Â A normal conus medullaris terminates at L1. Â Multilevel spondylosis and moderate - to - severe degenerative disc disease are again seen. This has progressed in some levels. Â Degenerative bone marrow signal change is evident then multiple levels. No other significant abnormality of bone marrow signal is seen. Â Central canal is reduced in two serum_folate as discussed below. Â In T11 - 12, a chronic petition_skimps posterior disc - osteophyte complex results in mild central stenosis with some distortion of cord and thecal sac contour. This may be the etiology of the thoracic myelopathy described on the history for the 2017 MRI request. However, cord signal remains normal, showing no edema or evidence for myelomalacia. The mild stenosis appears relatively stable. Â In T12 - L1 and in L1 - 2, minor broad posterior disc bulges are stable, causing no neural compromise. The facet joints show minor degenerative change without definite osteoarthritis. Â In L2 - 0xff, severe disc degeneration has nearly obliterated the intervertebral disc, representing a significant adverse change from 2017 when the disc was near normal. There is minor retrolisthesis. A broad posterior disc bulge associated with the disc degeneration is slightly eccentric towards the right side. There is now mild central stenosis, with slight distortion in the thecal sac contour. However, no convincing nerve root compromise is seen, as perineural fat is still preserved bilaterally with respect to exiting and descending nerves. Mild / moderate osteoarthritis of the bilateral facet joints is present. Â Previously seen fluid between spinous processes of L2 and L3 has resolved, leaving advanced wet_macular_degeneration change. Â L3 - 4 remains stable. A broad posterior disc bulge slightly indents the ventral thecal sac but does not cause any convincing neural compromise. Previously suggested mild central stenosis shows no adverse change. Moderately severe bilateral facet OA is evident. Â L4 - 5 is stable. The JAKKS_diverse posterior disc bulge indents the ventral thecal sac but does not cause convincing neural compromise. The previously described mild bilateral foraminal stenosis shows no progression. Perineural fat is still preserved. Severe bilateral facet OA is again evident, with minimal degenerative grade 1 anterolisthesis which was previously present. Â L5 - S1 is stable. The minimal broad posterior disc bulge barely touches the thecal sac because of the capacious size of the central canal in this level. Neural elements Remained fully intact with no compromise. Severe bilateral facet OA is again seen. Â Impression: Â Multilevel degenerative disc disease and spondylosis are again seen. The only adverse change from 2017 is the development of new severe degenerative disc disease in L2 - 3 which was previously near normal. Â The above produces a new level of mild central tricuspid. Â Prior mild central stenosis in T11 - T12 remains stable; while there wouldbe still be mild cord compression, the cord does not show any edema or evidence of myelomalacia. Clinical correlation is required regarding any persistence of the thoracic myelopathy clinically described in 2017. Â Again no other potential neural compromise is seen on this study, and there is no specific site of convincing nerve root compromise. Â Moderate to severe facet OA is present in most levels.",1
,"As noted before, there is evidence of the tethered cord and the spinal cord extends to the S1 level where it is tethered posteriorly. No evidence of any lipoma nor any other abnormality in the spinal canal.

The posterior longitudinal ligament appears to be expanded and is widened in the AP dimension from the   level of the top of C6 2 the upper third of the C7 vertebral body posteriorly.  This produces a convexity which indents the   anterior aspect of the cervical cord at the C6-7 level.

No central canal or neural foraminal compromise identified.       IMPRESSION: Slightly unusual appearance identified at C6-7 where there does appear to be a focal disc protrusion in a left   paracentral location.  I suspect that there is a small defect in the posterior longitudinal ligament allowing the focal herniation  to extend into/through the ligament with further extrusion in a superior and inferior direction at the posterior aspect of the   posterior longitudinal ligament this results in a posterior convexity indenting the cervical cord resulting in deformation of the   cord and some signal change within the substance of the cord in keeping with high-grade central canal stenosis.

432.0,"MRI LUMBAR SPINE  History:  Tripped September 7. Back and right leg pain. Rule out disc herniation/sciatica. Weak  L5/L4.  Technique:  MRI of the lumbar spine.  Findings:  Comparison is made with a previous MRI from October 2, 2008  Vertebral body height is maintained. Alignment is unremarkable. Developmental  narrow spinal canal. Assuming 5 lumbar type vertebral bodies the conus medullaris  terminates at L1. The conus is unremarkable in appearance. No bone marrow edema.  L3-4: Disc height and signal are preserved. No disc bulge or protrusion.  Developmentally narrow spinal canal. No acquired spinal canal or neural foraminal  narrowing.  L4-5: Disc height and signal are preserved. No disc bulge or protrusion.  Developmentally narrow spinal canal. No acquired spinal canal or neural foraminal  narrowing.  L5-S1: Mild disc height loss. Moderate disc desiccation. Posterior central disc  protrusion/extrusion, reduced in size compared with the previous MRI.. The disc  protrusion now measures 0.4 cm in AP dimension (previously 0.8 cm) Posterior central  annular fissure. Mild facet degenerative changes. Mild narrowing of the right and left  neural foramen. No evidence of nerve root impingement. The central spinal canal is  patent.  IMPRESSION: The previously demonstrated L5-S1 posterior central disc protrusion/extrusion has  reduced in size compared with the previous MRI measuring approximately 0.4 cm in AP  dimension. No nerve root impingement. No acute osseous abnormality.  The Workers' Compensation Board has requested that we provide a professional  opinion as to whether the imaging findings are related whole or in part to the injury in  question. This is not considered part of the official diagnostic imaging report, and will  only be used to help a WCB caseworker decide whether the injury is work-related or  not. My opinion is:  Some of the imaging findings could be related to the patient's injury.",0
680.0,"FINDINGS:  There is straightening of the normal cervical lordosis which may be positional, or  secondary to underlying mild degenerative change. There is a mild convex right  curvature of the cervical spine present. The posterior fossa structures are  unremarkable. There is no evidence for Chiari malformation. The vertebral artery flow  voids are maintained bilaterally. Cervical spinal cord is of normal contour, caliber and  signal. There is no abnormal signal hyperintensity or evidence of syrinx demonstrated.  The prevertebral and paravertebral soft tissues to the extent visualized are  unremarkable. Level by level information as follows:  The atlantooccipital articulations are normally aligned. The atlantodental interval is  maintained. The lateral mass articulation alignment at C1-C2 is preserved.  At C2-3, mild degenerative disc disease with loss of intranuclear T2 signal without  evidence for spinal canal or foraminal stenosis. The facet joints are well-maintained  bilaterally.  At C3-4, mild degenerative disc disease with diffuse loss of intranuclear T2 signal with  tiny anterior endplate osteophyte with very shallow left central disc protrusion,  unchanged from prior without evidence for spinal canal or foraminal stenosis. Facet  joints are well-maintained.  At C4-5, mild degenerative disc disease with loss of intranuclear T2 signal, but no  evidence for spinal canal or foraminal stenosis. Facet joints are relatively well maintained bilaterally.  At C5-C6, tiny central disc protrusion minimally more prominent compared to the  previous examination which indents the ventral thecal sac without evidence for  significant spinal canal or foraminal stenosis. The ventral spinal cord minimally flattens  at this level. Facet joints are well-maintained bilaterally.  At C6-7, minor degenerative disc disease with minor loss of intranuclear T2 signal  without evidence for spinal canal or foraminal stenosis. Facet joints are wellmaintained.  At C7-T1, signal from intervertebral disc is well-maintained without evidence for spinal  canal or foraminal stenosis. Facet joints are unremarkable.  As visualized in the sagittal plane, T1-2, T2-3 and T3-4, signal from intervertebral discs  is well maintained without evidence for spinal canal or foraminal stenosis.  IMPRESSION:  MRI of the cervical spine demonstrates mild degenerative disc disease, the  overall appearances of which are relatively similar to the examination performed  November 30, 2018. However, there is a tiny central disc protrusion/disc  osteophyte complex at C5-6 is minimally more prominent compared to prior  which is associated with very subtle ventral spinal cord flattening. No foraminal stenosis at this level.",0
574.0,"Reason for Exam: 4-WK HX OF LOWER BACK PAIN IN THE L4-5 AND L5-S1 REGION ON THE LEFT.  DEVELOPED PAIN IN THE LEFT L4 DISTRIBUTION.  Â   QUERY LT L4-5 DISC PROTRUSION  Â   Â   Â   TECHNICAL: Routine sagittal and axial T1 and T2.  Â   COMPARISON: CT 2012 and radiographic study 2020.  Â   FINDINGS:    Â   According to previous radiographic studies, patient has 6 nonrib-bearing vertebral bodies, aplastic ribs at the T12 level suspected. To keep the consistency of labeling system, in this MRI report, the first nonrib-bearing vertebral body is labeled T12.  Â   There is straightening of lumbar spine, likely secondary to positioning or muscle spasm.  Vertebral body height is preserved.  Bone marrow signal is unremarkable. Small amount of T1 and T2 hyperintensity in the subchondral region of L4 vertebral body, likely Modic type II degenerative endplate change. Multilevel disc desiccation with disc space narrowing, finding is most prominent from L3 to L5 levels. The visualized spinal cord is of normal caliber and signal and the conus medullaris is in normal position.  Visualized extraspinal structures are unremarkable.  Â   At the included levels above L3, there is no significant spondylosis and the spinal canal and intervertebral foramina are widely patent.  Â   At L3-L4: Diffuse disc bulging. Mild central canal stenosis, AP dimension measures 2.8 cm.  Minimal right lateral recess narrowing, finding can potentially cause impingement of the right L4 nerve roots. No significant neural foramen stenosis.  Â   At L4-L5: Disc protrusion involving the left paracentral region, measuring 14 x 6 mm (transverse by AP). There is left lateral recess stenosis, finding can cause compression of the left L5 nerve roots.  Severe central canal stenosis, AP dimension measures 3 mm.  No significant neural foramen stenosis.  Â   At L5-S1: No significant spondylosis.  Spinal canal and intervertebral foramina widely patent.  Â   IMPRESSION: Multilevel degenerative disc disease.  Finding is most significant at L4/5 level with significant central canal stenosis and left lateral recess stenosis.",0

C5 / 6: Minimal disc osteophyte complex is noted with no significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing. C6 / 7: hardly significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing. C7 / T1: No significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing. 12 x 9 mm T2 hyperintense focus within the subcutaneous soft tissue of the back on the left at the level of C6 / 7 may represent a sebaceous cyst. MRI LUMBAR SPINE: 5 lumbar - type vertebrae are noted. Fatty endplate degenerative changes are noted at L4 / 5. Concave - like depression of the inferior endplate of L5 is unchanged dating back to the CT study of February 2008. There is otherwise normal alignment of the vertebral bodies and facet joints with no other significant loss in vertebral body height. The conus medullaris terminates at the level of T12 / L1 and is within normal limits in appearance. No significant degenerative disc changes, spinal canal narrowing or neural foraminal narrowing at T12 / L1, L1 / 2, or L2 / 3. L3 / 4: Disc protrusion is averred centered to the left of the midline indenting the thecal sac with moderate compression of the thecal sac. The left traversing L4 nerve root is being contacted and appears to be getting flattened against the ligamentum flavum. No significant neural foraminal narrowing. L4 / 5: Disc bulge is noted with a broad - based posterior disc protrusion that is contacting the traversing L5 nerve roots, left greater than right. Mild spinal_fusion canal narrowing is noted with no significant neural foraminal narrowing. L5 / F###S: Small broad - based posterior disc protrusion is noted centered to the right of the midline minimally contacting the traversing S1 nerve roots. No significant spinal canal narrowing. Posterolateral osteophytosis is contributing to mild neural foraminal narrowing. Fetal lobulations may account for the slightly lobulated appearance of the left kidney on the localizer images. This can be confirmed with ultrasound. IMPRESSION: Degenerative changes within the lumbar spine as described above. At L3 / 4, disc protrusion is resulting in moderate compression of the thecal sac and the left traversing L4 nerve root appears to be getting flattened against the ligamentum flavum. At L4 / 5, the traversing L5 nerve roots are properly contacted, left greater than right, with mild spinal canal narrowing overall. At L5 / S1, minimal contact of the traversing S1 nerve roots is noted with mild neural foraminal narrowing. No significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing is demonstrated within the cervical spine. Fetal lobulations may account for the slightly lobulated appearance of the left kidney on the localizer images. Correlation with ultrasound is recommended. 12 x 9 mm T2 hyperintense focus within the subcutaneous soft tissue of the back on the left at the level of C6 / 7 may represent a sebaceous cyst.",1

COMPARISON:    Lumbar spine x-rays January 23, 2020 and lumbar spine MRI December 1, 2017      FINDINGS:   Patient has had right-sided hemilaminectomy of L3-4 and L4-5 with decompression and synovial cyst resection on May 24, 2018.      Five lumbar vertebrae of normal morphology are visualized. The lumbar spine lordosis is maintained. Vertebral body heights are preserved.  No suspicious bone marrow signal abnormality.  The conus medullaris is normal in appearance and terminates at the L1 vertebral body level.        Of note, the incompletely assessed uterus appears bulky and a possible submucosal fibroid is seen, distorting the endometrial lining.      Levels T10-T11 to L1-L2 are unremarkable.  The patient tiny posterior disc bulge is present at L2-L3.  Neural foramina remain patent.  No spinal canal stenosis.      No abnormal enhancement seen on post gadolinium imaging.      L3-4:   8 mm anterolisthesis of L3 on L4 associated with superior uncovering of the disc posteriorly. There is a superimposed small posterior central disc protrusion. Adjacent endplates show diffuse low T1 signal.  Evidence of the right hemilaminectomy.  Advanced left facet hypertrophic osteoarthritis is present and a 7 x 5 x 7 mm (AP x TR x CC) presumed synovial cyst protrudes anteromedially into the spinal canal, further contributing to the overall moderate to severe spinal canal stenosis.  A linear area of increased T2 signal is also seen about the right facet joint medially, possibly representing a recurrent or residual synovial cyst.  The left lateral recess is obliterated, accounting for compression of the left L4 traversing nerve root.  There is moderate left and mild right neural foramina narrowing.      L4-5:    There is a small central disc extrusion indenting the anterior aspect of the thecal sac.  Advanced left facet hypertrophic osteoarthritis is present with asymmetrical thickening of the ligamentum flavum, further contributing to the distortion of the spinal canal.  No spinal canal stenosis. The previously visualized synovial cyst arising from the right facet joint has been surgically removed.  Lateral recesses remain patent.  There is mild left neural foramen narrowing.      L5-S1:   Disc height is severely reduced and pronounced surrounding endplate osteophytes are present.

Mild anterior wedging of the T8, T9, and T10 vertebral bodies is similar to the prior CT study of January 28, 2019.  Multilevel endplate degenerative changes with undulation of the endplates within the mid/lower thoracic spine associated with small Schmorl's nodes are also again noted.  An exaggeration of the thoracic kyphosis centered at T8/9 is also similar to the prior CT study.  There is otherwise normal alignment of the vertebral bodies and facet joints.     On the localizer images, prominent T2 hyperintensity within the L5 vertebral body may relate to an underlying hemangioma. Small superior Schmorl's nodes are also noted at L5 and S1.     Focal ventral distortion of the thoracic spinal cord is noted at the level of T8, abutting the T8 vertebral body.  The posterior aspect of the thoracic spinal cord at the level of T8 has a focally angulated appearance.  Abnormal T2 hyperintensity is noted within the thoracic spinal cord at the level of T8 extending to the level of T9.     Hypertrophic degenerative facet arthropathy is contributing to mild neural foraminal narrowing at T11/12.  No other significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing throughout the thoracic spine.     IMPRESSION:  Appearances are compatible with a spinal cord herniation at the level of T8.  Abnormal T2 hyperintense signal within the thoracic spinal cord at T8/9 is compatible with cord edema/myelomalacia.     Other changes as described above.     **** CRITICAL RESULT ****     Finding may require intervention and or follow-up",1

,Reason for Exam: LEFT SIDED SCIATICA WITH PAIN DOWN TO TOES. SOME BOWEL DYSFUNCTION AS WELL. QUERY SHOULD_HAVE_BEEN ROOT IMPINGEMENT. Technique: Routine lumbar spine protocol is performed. Findings: Lumbar spine alignment is normal. Vertebral body heights are maintained. The conus medullaris and cauda equina are normal. At the T12 - L1 level the disc is normal. The thecal sac and exiting nerve roots are free of compression. At the L1 - 2 level there is a small left paracentral disc protrusion which minimally compresses the anterior aspect of the thecal sac on the left. The exiting and transiting nerve roots are free of compression. At the L2 - 3 level there is some circumferential disc bulging causing minimal compression on the anterior aspect of the thecal sac. The exiting and transiting sweat_gland roots are free of compression. At the L3 - 4 level there is circumferential disc bulging with a small right paracentral disc protrusion. There is minimal compression on the anterior aspect of the thecal sac and some mild lateral recess stenosis is seen. There is some mild foraminal encroachment bilaterally but no definite exiting nerve root or transiting nerve root compressions are seen. At the L4 - 5 level there is circumferential disc bulging with a small to moderate posterior midline disc protrusion with moderate frostbite_hypothermia facet joint osteoarthritis bilaterally. This causes mild central canal stenosis and moderate severe lateral schoolday stenosis bilaterally. Meantime exiting nerve roots are free of compression. There is severe transiting nerve root compression bilaterally. At the L5 - S1 level there is circumferential disc bulging. There is a 14 x 9 x 12 #.#mm_x mass identified in the left lateral recess at the level of Markus_Cornaro L5 vertebral body likely representing extruded disc material however a neurofibroma or other neoplastic lesion would be in the differential diagnosis. This causes moderate compression of By_TREVON_MILLIARD left anterolateral aspect of the thecal sac. It appears to be causing severe compression of the exiting left L5 nerve root as it enters the foramina. Transiting nerve roots remain free of compression. The exiting right nerve root is free of compression. There is severe facet joint osteoarthritis stressing bilaterally. IMPRESSION: Multilevel degenerative disc changes with facet joint osteoarthritis at several levels. Masslike abnormality in the left lateral recess superior to the L5 - S1 disc space causing severe compression of the exiting left L5 nerve root. This most likely emphasizes extruded disc material however a neoplastic lesion cannot be completely excluded. Further investigation with a contrast - enhanced study could be helpful.,1

BUT SHE GOT SICK. ?SPINAL STENOSIS      HISTORY:  As above.     TECHNIQUE:  Standard radiculopathy protocol, consisting of sagittal T1 and T2 imaging from T9 to the upper sacrum and axial T1 and T2 imaging from L3-4 to L5-S1.     FINDINGS:  Comparison made to the MR lumbar spine from April 26, 2016 (Grey Nuns Hospital). Lumbar spine x-rays performed December 5, 2016 (St. Paul HCC) and CT abdomen/pelvis from August 27, 2018 (Cold Lake HCC) were also reviewed.     Five lumbar vertebrae are assumed. Moderate curvature of the lumbar spine convex right centered at L3-4. Vertebral body heights are maintained. No focal destructive osseous lesions.     The lower thoracic spinal cord and conus medullaris are suboptimally assessed due to motion artifact. They appear grossly normal in caliber. Conus terminates in a normal fashion at the L1 level. No fatty filum terminale.     Hypointense T2 signal noted within most of the lower thoracic and lumbar discs, indicative of underlying disc degeneration.     Similar tiny posterior disc protrusions are present at the T9-10, T10-11 and T11-12 levels, indenting the thecal sac but not affecting the spinal cord or nerve roots. No spinal stenosis or significant neural foraminal narrowing at these levels.     At T12-L1, disc height is preserved. Mild annular disc bulging is present. No nerve root impingement, spinal stenosis or neural foraminal stenosis. Minor facet degenerative changes.     At L1-2, there is similar subtle retrolisthesis of L1 on L2. Mild loss of disc height eccentrically towards the right. A small right paracentral disc-osteophyte complex indents the thecal sac but does not affect the conus. Moderate stenosis of the right neural foramen noted. No stenosis of the left neural foramen. No spinal stenosis. Minor facet degenerative changes. Appearances are not significantly changed.     At L2-3, disc height is reasonably well-maintained. A small broad-based posterior disc-osteophyte complex indents the ventral thecal sac and encroaches upon the inferior aspects of both neural foramina, resulting in bilateral neural foraminal stenoses of mild to moderate severity. Mild to moderate left-sided and minor right-sided facet degenerative changes. Slight narrowing of the left lateral recess. No stenosis of the right lateral recess. No spinal stenosis. Appearances are not significantly changed.     At L3-4, there remains moderate loss of disc height laterally towards the left with associated moderately advanced degenerative endplate changes. Moderate left-sided and mild right-sided facet degenerative changes and mild ligamentum flavum thickening also noted. A small broad-based disc-osteophyte complex indents the ventral thecal sac. Moderate stenosis of the left lateral recess and moderate to severe narrowing of the left neural foramen noted. Minor narrowing of the right neural foramen. Right lateral recess remains normal in caliber. No significant spinal stenosis. Appearances overall are not significantly changed.     At L4-5, disc height is well-maintained. Bilateral moderate to severe facet degenerative changes are present with ligamentum flavum thickening. A small broad-based posterior disc-osteophyte complex indents the ventral thecal sac. A 6 mm circumscribed focus of hyperintense T1 and T2 signal situated along the anteromedial aspect of the right facet joint is unchanged. This corresponds to a either a small focus of ossification or calcified synovial cyst on the CT scan, contributing to moderate to severe right lateral recess stenosis. There is mild transverse narrowing of the thecal sac posteriorly. No significant left lateral recess narrowing. Mild stenoses of both neural foramina. Appearances overall are similar to the prior MR study.     At L5-S1, there is grade 1-2 spondylolisthesis of 6 mm, worse compared to the 2016 study. Disc height is reasonably well-maintained. There is unroofing of the posterior disc margin, with a small shallow disc bulge indenting the ventral thecal sac. There is severe degeneration of the left facet joint, with severe joint space narrowing and adjacent sclerosis and bony overgrowth evident. Moderate degeneration of the right facet joint also noted. Unilateral right-sided spondylolysis of L5 is again evident. Combination of these findings results in bilateral lateral recess stenoses of at least moderate severity and moderate spinal stenosis. There is severe stenosis of the right neural foramen with virtually complete effacement of the perineural fat and compression and flattening of the exiting right L5 nerve root. Moderate to severe stenosis of the left neural foramen also noted.     Mild degenerative changes noted within the visualized sacroiliac joints. Prevertebral soft tissues are unremarkable.     OPINION:  1. Spondylolisthesis of L5 on S1 is slightly worse compared to the 2016 MR examination. Anterolisthesis is secondary to a combination of right L5 spondylolysis and bilateral facet degeneration. Facet degeneration is severe on the left side. There is severe stenosis of the right L5-S1 neural foramen with compression of the exiting right L5 nerve root. Moderate to severe stenosis of the left neural foramen, bilateral lateral recess stenoses of moderate severity and moderate spinal stenosis at this level also.     2. Multilevel degenerative disc disease in the remainder of the spine is of similar severity, as detailed above. Moderate to severe stenosis of the right lateral recess at L4-5 secondary to a combination of disc degeneration, facet degeneration and small focus of ossification (or synovial cyst with peripheral calcification) at the anteromedial aspect of the right facet joint. Spinal stenosis of moderate severity at L4-5 also.",0

369.0,"MR LUMBAR SPINE       Reason for Exam: SEVERE SPINAL STENOSIS FOR POSSIBLE SURGERY.   HX LAMINECTOMY. L  -L4, 2009     An MRI of the lumbar spine performed 19 September, 2014 is available for comparison.     A clinical history of ""severe spinal stenosis for possible surgery"" has been provided.     TECHNICAL:     Sagittal and axial T1- and T2-weighted sequences were performed.     FINDINGS:     This report assumes five lumbar-type vertebrae. A subtle curvature is present convex to the right which may in part be related to patient positioning. The vertebral body heights are relatively well-maintained allowing for Schmorl's node formation associated with the endplates throughout the lumbar region and are stable in appearance when compared with the prior study performed in September of 2014. The bone marrow signal is fairly homogeneous allowing for hemangiomata/fatty rests as well as degenerative endplate changes at several levels. There is evidence for a prior posterior decompression procedure at the L4 level with associated postoperative changes within the overlying soft tissues posterior to the osseous spinal column. The conus medullaris terminates normally at approximately the L1 level.     At the S1/2 level, an underdeveloped disc is noted. No significant neural foraminal compromise or compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.     At the L5/S1 level, a prominent anterior osteophyte is noted straddling the midline. Moderate degenerative endplate changes are present along with moderate-to-advanced narrowing of the intervertebral disc. A trace amount of vacuum phenomenon is suspected within the intervertebral disc. Disc/osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline which extends laterally protruding into the inferior aspect of the neural foramen bilaterally. A minuscule focus of abnormal increased T2 signal is present within the disc annulus posteriorly to the right of midline, compatible with an annular fissure. Degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints, mild-to-moderate on the left and mild on the right. The findings are resulting in moderate-to-severe compromise of the right neural foramen and moderate compromise of the left neural foramen. No significant compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.     At the L4/5 level, moderate degenerative endplate changes are present, more prominent eccentric to the left. Narrowing of the intervertebral disc is present, fairly advanced on the left and moderate on the right. Disc/osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline which extends laterally protruding into the inferior aspect of the neural foramen bilaterally. The posterior disc/osteophyte complex appears to involve the traversing L5 nerve root bilaterally, more prominent on the left side. Moderate degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints. There is hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum. The findings are resulting in moderate compromise of the adjacent thecal sac as well as severe compromise of the right neural foramen and moderate inferior neural foraminal compromise on the left. Subtle clumping of the nerve roots is noted within the thecal sac at this level, raising the possibility of arachnoiditis.     At the L3/4 level, moderate degenerative endplate changes are present, more prominent eccentric to the left. Narrowing of the intervertebral disc is present, advanced on the left and moderate-to-advanced on the right. Disc/osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline which extends laterally protruding into the inferior aspect of the neural foramen bilaterally, slightly more striking on the left side. A superimposed small disc extrusion persists posteriorly straddling the midline, but more prominent to the left of midline, which has diminished in size when compared with the prior study and likely involves the traversing L4 nerve root. Mild degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints. The findings are resulting in the severe compromise of the left neural foramen and mild-to-moderate compromise of the right neural foramen as well as minimal/mild compromise of the adjacent thecal sac.     At the L2/3 level, a prominent anterior osteophyte is noted straddling the midline. Moderate degenerative endplate changes are present, more prominent eccentric to the right. Narrowing of the intervertebral disc is present, advanced on the right and moderate on the left. Disc/osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline which extends laterally protruding into the inferior aspect of the neural foramen bilaterally. A minuscule focus of abnormal increased T2 signal is noted within the disc annulus posteriorly, compatible with an annular fissure. The posterior disc/osteophyte complex appears to contact but not significantly displace the traversing L3 nerve roots. Mild-to-moderate degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints. The findings are resulting in moderate compromise of the left neural foramen and mild compresses of the right neural foramen. No significant compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.     At the L1/2 level, a small anterior osteophyte is noted straddling the midline. Mild degenerative endplate changes are present along with mild-to-moderate narrowing of the intervertebral disc. A minuscule shallow disc protrusion is present posteriorly in the midline which does not appear to involve the traversing L2 nerve roots. Minor disc/osteophyte complex is present laterally protruding into the inferior aspect of the right neural foramen. Mild degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints. The findings are resulting in minimal compromise of the right neural foramen. The left neural foramen is patent and no significant compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.     The remainder of the visualized levels are unremarkable allowing for at least mild degenerative facet joint changes.     Atheromatous irregularity is present throughout the abdominal aorta extending into the iliac arteries bilaterally. Diffuse atrophic change is present involving the posterior paraspinal musculature, most prominent inferior to the L4/5 level. To the extent visualized, the regional soft tissue structures are otherwise unremarkable.     IMPRESSION:     Findings compatible with the prior posterior decompression procedure at the L4 level. Degenerative changes are present involving the intervertebral disc and the facet joints at multiple levels resulting in neural foraminal compromise at several levels as well as moderate compromise of the thecal sac/spinal canal at the L4/5 level, as detailed above. The degenerative disc and facet joint changes as well as the resultant neural foraminal compromise have progressed since the prior study performed 19 September, 2014. The degree of compromise of the thecal sac at the L4/5 level also appears to have slightly progressed when compared with the prior study performed 19 September, 2014.     A disc extrusion persists posteriorly straddling the midline, but more prominent to the left of midline at the L3/L4 level which has diminished in size with less resultant compromise of the adjacent thecal sac when compared with the prior study performed 19 September, 2014.       ",0

97.0,"MR LUMBAR SPINE      Reason for Exam: RADICULAR PAIN RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY ASSOCIATED WITH LOW BACK PAIN.  QUERY NERVE IMPINGEMENT IN LUMBAR SPINE.     Radiographs of the lumbar spine performed June 27, 2018 are available for comparison.     A clinical history of ""right-sided radicular pain"" has been provided.     TECHNICAL:     Sagittal and axial T1- and T2-weighted sequences were performed.     FINDINGS:     This report assumes five lumbar-type vertebrae.  At least a moderate curvature is present convex to the left, centered at the L2/3 level.  The accompanying radiographs demonstrate that the L3 vertebral body is subluxed to the left with respect to the L4 vertebral body which measures approximately 1 cm.  The vertebral body heights are relatively well-maintained.  The bone marrow signal is unremarkable allowing for hemangiomata/fatty rests, as well as degenerative endplate changes at multiple levels.  The conus medullaris terminates normally at approximately the level of the T12/L1 intervertebral disc.     At the L5/S1 level, the intervertebral disc is unremarkable.  Degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints, moderate on the left and mild on the right.  No significant neural foraminal compromise or compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.     At the L4/5 level, degenerative endplate changes are present, more prominent eccentric to the left.  Narrowing of the intervertebral disc is present, advanced on the left and minimal/mild on the right.  A small amount of vacuum phenomenon is suspected within the intervertebral disc, eccentric to the left.  Minimal circumferential disc bulging is present, which appears to contact but not significantly displace or compress the traversing L5 nerve roots.  Disc/osteophyte complex is present posterolaterally extending into the left neural foramen.  Degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints, at least moderate on the left and mild on the right.  The findings are resulting in severe compromise of the left neural foramen.  The right neural foramen is patent and no significant compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.     At the L3/L4 level, degenerative endplate changes are present along with moderate-to-advanced narrowing of the intervertebral disc.  Disc/osteophyte complex is present posteriorly which extends laterally protruding into the neural foramen bilaterally.  A superimposed tiny disc protrusion/extrusion is present posteriorly in the midline which may contact the traversing left L4 nerve root.  Moderate degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints which appear to result in a subtle retrolisthesis of the body of L3 with respect to the body of L4 which measures approximately 1-2 mm.  The findings are resulting in moderate-to-severe neural foraminal compromise bilaterally.  No significant compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.     At the L2/3 level, degenerative endplate changes are present, more prominent eccentric to the right.  Narrowing of the intervertebral disc is present, advanced on the right and at least mild on the left.  Disc/ossify complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline which extends laterally protruding into the neural foramen bilaterally, more prominent on the right side.  The posterior disc/osteophyte complex appears to at least contact the traversing L3 nerve root bilaterally, more prominent on the right side.  Degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints, moderate on the right and mild on the left which appears to result in a subtle retrolisthesis of the body of L2 with respect to the body of L3 which measures approximately 2 mm.  The findings are resulting in at least moderate compromise of the right neural foramen and minimal compromise of the left neural foramen.  No significant compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.     At the L1/2 level, degenerative endplate changes are present along with mild narrowing of the intervertebral disc.  A tiny/small disc extrusion along with an annular fissure is present posteriorly straddling the midline which does not appear to involve the traversing L2 nerve roots.  Degenerative change is present involving the facet joints, mild on the right and minimal on the left, which appears to result in a subtle retrolisthesis of the body of L1 with respect to the body of L2 which measures approximately 1-2 mm.  The findings are resulting in the mild compromise of the right neural foramen.  The left neural foramen is patent and no significant compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.     At the T12/L1 level, mild degenerative endplate changes and subtle narrowing of the intervertebral disc are present.  A tiny disc protrusion along with an annular fissure are present posteriorly straddling the midline, but slightly more prominent to the left of midline.  Mild degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints.  No significant neural foraminal compromise or compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.     At the T11/12 level, subtle degenerative endplate changes and mild narrowing of the intervertebral disc are present.  A minuscule disc protrusion is present posteriorly in the midline.  Minor degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints.  No significant neural foraminal compromise or compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.     At the T10/11 level, mild degenerative endplate changes are present along with mild-to-moderate narrowing of the intervertebral disc.  A minuscule disc diffusion is present posteriorly to the left of midline.  Minor degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints.  No significant neural foraminal compromise or compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.  A small incidental perineural cyst is noted within the right neural foramen.     At the T9/10 level, degenerative endplate changes are present along with moderate narrowing of the intervertebral disc.  Minor disc/ossify complex is present posteriorly.  Relatively minor degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints.  No significant neural foraminal compromise or compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.  A tiny incidental perineural cyst is noted within the left neural foramen.     At least mild atheromatous irregularity is present involving the abdominal aorta extending into the iliac arteries bilaterally.  A cystic focus is present arising from the anterosuperior aspect of the right kidney which measures approximately 1 cm in maximal dimension along with a similar-appearing focus arising from the inferior aspect of the left kidney measuring approximately 1.2 cm in maximal dimension.  Diffuse atrophic change is present throughout the visualized posterior paraspinal musculature, gluteal musculature and psoas musculature.  To the extent visualized, the regional soft tissue structures are otherwise unremarkable.     IMPRESSION:     A prominent curvature is present involving the lumbar spine convex to the left.

Postop course concave   by epidural scarring and arachnoiditis. Continues to report back pain and lower extremity cramping.    Â   Protocol:  Routine lumbar spine with sagittal T2, sagittal T1 and axial T2 sequences.    Â   FINDINGS:    Â   Five lumbar type vertebrae demonstrate grossly unremarkable alignment.   For the purposes of this report, the lowest free   vertebrae is labeled L5.  Marrow signal is normal.   The conus terminates normally at L1.     Â   The lower thoracic and upper lumbar spine demonstrates no significant abnormality.  No concerning extraspinal abnormality.     Â   L2-3: Moderate facet arthropathy.

FINDINGS: The lowest complete lumbar disc space is defined as L##_L## - S1 for the purposes of this report. There is a slight straightening of the natural lumbar lordosis potentially due to an element of muscle spasm. Lumbar vertebral height and alignment are otherwise preserved. No fractures. No spondylolisthesis. There is degenerative disc disease at L4 - 5 as detailed below. The remaining lumbar discs are reasonably well canopic_jars, although there are some prominent anterior endplate osteophytes at L3 - 4 and smaller endplate osteophytes at the other lumbar levels. The conus medullaris lies at L1. DISCS: T12 - L1 - Minor broad - based posterior disc bulge. No spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis. L1 - 2 - Normal disc.

Lower thoracic canal / foramina arethe patent. L1 - 2 disc shows mild right posterolateral annular bulging. The L1 nerve roots exit normally. The canal is patent. Mild degenerative facet joint overgrowth. The L2 - 3 disc shows degenerative osteophytic lipping with circumferential bulging that indents the inferior_parietal thecal sac and caudally narrows intervertebral foramina. The L2 nerve roots ouster normally. Mild degenerative facet joint overgrowth. Central canal remains adequately patent. L3 - S1 rewritable_discs show degenerative signal loss, narrowing, osteophytic lipping; with small circumferential disc osteophyte complexes that indent the ventral thecal sac and caudally narrow the intervertebral foramina. Further degrees of degenerative facet joint overgrowth, more advanced at L4 - 5. Degenerative facet joint overgrowth at L3 - 4 indents the posterolateral thecal sac and narrows the transverse dimension of the canal such that posterior epidural fat indents the posterior thecal sac. Discopathy indents the ventral thecal sac. Constellation of features results in moderate / marked stenosis of the thecal sac, its anteroposterior dimension reduced to More 5 - 6 mm in the midline. Lateral recess inlets are markedly narrowed. Attenuation of CSF and crowding of the cauda. Attenuated fat planes remain visible industrially_zoned the exiting L3 nerve roots. Grade 1 anterolisthesis of the L3 vertebral body on L4 of about 4 mm. Uncovering of the posterior annulus with marked caudal narrowing of intervertebral foramina. Advanced overgrowth of the facet joints narrows the transverse dimension of the canal, a small posterior epidural fat pad indenting the posterior thecal sac. Marked stenosis of the thecal sac, its anteroposterior and mediolateral dimensions reduced to a few millimeters. Attenuated fat planes remain visible adjacent WEB_VOTE_Which exiting L4 nerve roots.

On the sagittal T2 weighted counting study posterior disc osteophyte complexes are noted at C5-6 and C6-7 causing minor narrowing   of the AP dimensions of the canal without cord compression or altered cord signal.  There are multilevel thoracic spine   degenerative change with small posterior disc osteophyte complexes. One of these causes mild indentation of the theca at T3-4,   without significant narrowing of the spinal canal or associated cord signal abnormality.  There is circumferential bulge of the   L2-3, L3-4 and L4-5 intervertebral discs with some associated facetal degeneration and hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum at   these levels.   At L2-3 there is resultant narrowing of the subarticular zones bilaterally which, coupled with the presumed arachnoid cyst,   effaces the transiting L3 nerve roots.   The L3-4 disc similarly effaces the subarticular zones bilaterally and contacts but does not compress the exiting right L3 nerve   root within its far lateral recess.   The L4-5 disc narrows the subarticular zones bilaterally but does not compress transiting L5 nerve roots and does not contact the   exiting L4 nerves.   There is significant facetal hypertrophy at L5-S1 (R>L), narrowing the lateral dimensions of the spinal canal and contacting the   exiting right L5 nerve root without compression.     Multilevel mild neural foraminal narrowing is noted within the lumbar spine with moderate neural foraminal narrowing on the left   at L4/5.  Hypertrophic degenerative facet arthropathy is contributing to mild to moderate right neural foraminal narrowing at   T6/7 and mild to moderate left neural foraminal narrowing at T8/9.     There is partial fatty infiltration of the paraspinal musculature.     Opinion:   Multilevel lower cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine degenerative changes as described     Long segment intradural CSF signal lesion extending from the level of the T11 vertebral body to L4, compressing and anteriorly   displacing the distal spinal cord and cauda equina, without definite associated intrinsic altered cord signal.    Distortion/tethering of the thoracic spinal cord from the level of T8-T11 is suggestive of underlying adhesions. Features are   most in keeping with a spinal arachnoid cyst (Nabor type III spinal meningeal cyst).  Diffusion-weighted imaging was mildly   degraded by motion artifact but there was no definite diffusion restriction to suggest a spinal epidermoid cyst. No lesional   gadolinium enhancement.

MRI - SEP 2016 - SLIGHT NERVE ROOT IRRITATION OF L L5 NERVE ROOT. HISTORY: As above. TECHNIQUE: Standard radiculopathy protocol, consisting of sagittal T1 and T2 imaging from T11 - 12 to the mid sacrum and axial T1 and T2 imaging from L1 - 2 to L5 - S1. FINDINGS: Comparison made to the MR lumbar spine from September 24, 2016 (UAH ). Lumbar spine x - rays performed September 9, 2019 (Allin Clinic) were also reviewed. Similar curvature of the lumbar sacroiliac_joint convex right, centered at L2 - 3. Vertebral body heights are maintained. Small Schmorl ' s nodes within the endplates in the thoracolumbar spine. Marrow signal is unremarkable. No focal destructive osseous lesions. Hypointense T2 disc signal noted within several of the discs, reflecting disc degeneration. At T11 - 12, there is moderate loss of disc height. A small disc - osteophyte complex does not affect the conus or nerve roots. No spinal stenosis or neural foraminal stenosis. At T12 - L1, disc height is maintained. AN_INDEPENDENT small posterior remastered - osteophyte complex does not affect the conus or nerve roots. No discogenic stenosis or significant neural foraminal stenosis. At L1 - 2, disc height is maintained. A small annular disc bulge does not cause any nerve root impingement. Slight narrowing of both neural foramina. No spinal stenosis. Minor facet degenerative changes. At L2 - 3, disc height is maintained. A small annular disc bulge is present, with superimposed small far lateral disc protrusion on the left, encroaching upon the inferior aspect of the left neural foramen, abutting the exiting left L2 nerve root. Mild bilateral facet degenerative changes. No significant lateral recess stenosis or spinal stenosis. Mild stenosis of both neural foramina, more pronounced on the left. Appearances are unchanged. At L3 - 4, there is mild loss of disc height eccentrically towards the right. A small posterior disc bulge indents the thecal sac. Mild bilateral facet degenerative changes with mild ligamentum flavum thickening. Slight narrowing of both lateral recesses and mild narrowing of the left neural foramen but no significant spinal stenosis. Appearances are not significantly changed. At L4 - 5, there is new mild loss of disc height. New grade I spondylolisthesis of 4 mm noted, secondary to severe left - sided and moderate right - sided facet degeneration. The left - sided facet degeneration appears more severe, with osteophyte protruding anteromedially, encroaching upon the left lateral recess. A new, broad - based left paracentral / posterolateral disc extrusion is present, also encroaching upon the left lateral recess and proximal left neural foramen. As a result, there is now severe stenosis of the left lateral recess with compression of the descending left L5 nerve root. There may be impingement of SBKIY exiting left L4 nerve root also. Similar mild thinning of the right lateral recess. New mild transverse narrowing of the thecal sac. More pronounced narrowing of the left neural foramen, now mild to moderate in severity. No significant stenosis of the right neural foramen. At L5 - S1, there is similar mild loss of disc height. A small shallow disc bulge indents the thecal sac. Bilateral facet degenerative changes of mild to moderate severity. No spinal stenosis, significant lateral monthlong_recess narrowing nor neural foraminal stenosis. Appearances are not significantly changed. Prevertebral soft tissues and visualized sacroiliac joints are unremarkable. OPINION: 1. More pronounced disc degeneration at L4 - 5. New grade I spondylolisthesis at this level secondary to underlying bilateral (left greater than right) facet degeneration and hypertrophy. New severe stenosis of the left L4 - 5 lateral recess secondary to a combination of facet degeneration and new left - sided disc extrusion, with resultant compression of the descending left L5 nerve root and possible spinous_processes of the exiting left L4 nerve root. 2. Degenerative disc disease within the remainder of the spine is of similar severity compared to the 2016 MR study.",1

FINDINGS: There is approximately 9 mm anterolisthesis of L3 on L4. This appears secondary to bilateral L3 pars defects. There is a couple of millimeters retrolisthesis of L4 on L5. Otherwise the lumbar vertebral body heights and alignment are preserved. arthritis_bursitis endplate changes are noted adjacent to L3 - 4 and L4 - 5. The conus tip is normal at L1. At L2 - 3, the disc is normal. There does however appear to be a cystic alpha_helical dorsal to the midline thecal sac which may be arising off one of the L2 - four facet joints. Axial images did not quite extend through this lesion. However it causes only minor indentation on the dorsal midline thecal sac. At L3 - 4, there is uncovering of the disc and broad - based disc bulge with superimposed moderate - sized broad - based central disc extrusion with superior migration of disc material. This extends preferentially on the right more than the left and compresses the right more than left terminating L3 nerve roots. No minor spinal canal stenosis is demonstrated secondary to the pars defects. At L4 - 5, the disc is narrowed with minimal broad - based disc bulge. No spinal canal stenosis. Only minor inferior foraminal stenosis. At L5 - S1, the disc is normal with no disc herniation or spinal canal stenosis. Foramen are patent. There is partially conjoined right L5 and S1 nerve roots. TO_SUCCEED: Grade 2 arthrosis of L3 on L9 secondary to bilateral L3 spondylolysis. No significant spinal canal stenosis is demonstrated secondary to the pars defects but there is fairly severe right more than left foraminal stenosis secondary to broad - based disc extrusion more eccentric to the right. This compresses the exiting right more than left L3 nerve roots. Possible synovial cyst dorsal to the thecal sac at the L2 - 3 tiers although this is incompletely imaged.

For the purposes of this report (as well above to remain consistent with the prior radiograph reports ), the inferiormost fully - formed disc will be labeled the L5 / S1 level. Note is made of an underdeveloped disc at the S1 / 2 level as well as an anterolisthesis of the body of L3 with respect to the body of L4. A mild curvature is present convex to the left. The vertebral body heights are well - maintained and appear unchanged in the interval. The bone marrow signal is fairly homogeneous allowing for degenerative endplate changes at several levels, most notably at the L4 / 5 level and at the L3 / 4 level. The conus medullaris terminates normally at approximately the level of the T12 / L1 intervertebral disc. The a small incidental perineural cyst is noted within the sacral spinal canal at not S2 level. Â At the S1 / 2 level, an underdeveloped disc is noted. No significant neural foraminal compromise or compromise of the abutted thecal sac is appreciated. Â At the L5 / S1 level, the intervertebral disc is undramatic.

985.0,"MRI OF THE LUMBAR SPINE     HISTORY: Falling from leg weakness. ? Nerve impingement.     TECHNIQUE: Transverse and sagittal images were obtained through the lumbar spine and sacrum.     FINDINGS: There appear to be six lumbar-type vertebrae noted with the transitional L6 vertebra.     Vertebral body heights in the lumbar spine are maintained and bone marrow signals are normal.     The mid to upper sacral region is extremely deformed, likely secondary to radiation osteitis.     At the L3-L4 level, the disc is normal. The thecal sac, exiting, and transiting nerve roots are free of compression.     At the L4-L5 level, the disc is normal. The thecal sac, exiting, and transiting nerve roots are free of compression.     At the L5-L6 level, the disc is normal. The thecal sac, exiting, and transiting nerve roots are free of compression. There is severe facet joint osteoarthritis.     At the transition between the L6 vertebra and the sacrum, there is an old deformed disc. There is some mild foraminal encroachment bilaterally with some mild exiting nerve root compression seen.     The body of the sacrum is markedly deformed and shows some expansion and inhomogeneity of the bone. This appears to be causing significant encroachment of the sacral foramina with probable bilateral exiting nerve root compressions at several levels in the mid to upper sacrum. Multiple perineural root sleeve cysts are identified within the spinal canal, the largest on the right measuring 2.4 cm.     No definite pre-sacral soft tissue masses or fluid collections seen.     IMPRESSION:   The lumbar spine is relatively normal with no significant exiting or transiting nerve root compression seen. Again there is significant expansion of the bone of the sacrum likely due to prior radiation osteitis resulting in bilateral mid and upper sacral foraminal encroachments causing exiting nerve root compressions at several levels.

Vertebral body height appears preserved aside from mild superior endplate compression/degeneration at C6 and to minimal extent suspected at C7 as well.  Background marrow signal is unremarkable.  No convincing signal changes identified within the spinal cord.  No myelomalacia is suspected, but there is some mild compression as discussed below.       Above C4: There is mild disc desiccation but disc height is preserved.  No significant spondylosis is seen in the spinal canal and intervertebral foramina are widely patent.     C4-5: There is disc desiccation with mild anterior disc height loss and endplate degeneration.  No further spondylosis noted.  Spinal canal and intervertebral foramina widely patent.     C5-6: There is moderate degenerative disc disease with height loss and endplate change.  Moderate posterior disc osteophyte complex formation is present and extends to the uncovertebral joints, overall larger on the left side.  This results in mild spinal stenosis with effacement of the CSF in the thecal sac and with mild indentation of the spinal cord, more so on the left.  There is foraminal narrowing from the uncovertebral osteophytes to moderate to severe degree on the left and moderate degree on the right, and this may result in clinically significant exiting C6 nerve root impingement.     C6-7: There is disc desiccation with mild to moderate disc height loss.  Mild endplate degeneration is seen.  Mild posterior central focal disc protrusion is seen and mildly indents the thecal sac.  Moderate uncovertebral osteophytosis is seen bilaterally but is worse on the left.  The left foramen is moderately narrowed in the right foramen is mildly narrowed.  Minimal/mild narrowing of the spinal canal is less pronounced than at the C5-6 level.     C7-T4: There is mild disc desiccation at multiple levels but no significant disc height loss is seen.  Mild calcification of the posterior longitudinal ligament mildly encroaches upon the spinal canal and indents the thecal sac but does not appear to result in significant overall spinal stenosis.

263.0,"Narrative & Impression  Technique:     T1-weighted, T2-weighted and inversion recovery sagittal and T1 and T2-weighted axial images of the lumbar spine were obtained.  Post intravenous gadolinium enhanced T1-weighted fat-saturated sagittal and T1-weighted without fat saturated axial images were then repeated.     FINDINGS:     History of the L5-S1 discectomy and L3-4 hemilaminectomies in the past.  Previous postoperative MRI of February 24, 2017 is also reviewed.     There appears to be a transitional vertebra and for the description purposes, the last well-formed disc space would be designated as L5-S1, like in the previous report.     The conus medullaris terminates at the T12-L1.  It remains normal.     The T12-L1, L1-L2 and L2-L3 discs demonstrate mild generalized bulge.  It seems that the pedicles at the L2-L3 are congenitally short and this is associated with moderately severe thickening of the ligamenta flava and mild hypertrophic degenerative osteoarthritis of facet joints.  As a combination of these changes, at least a moderate or moderate to marked spinal stenosis has occurred at this level.  Degree of the spinal stenosis has increased in the interval.  The spinal canal is normal at the T12-L1 and L1-L2.     At L3-L4, a marked degenerative disc disease is seen.  Bilateral decompression hemilaminectomies have been performed at this level.  The spinal canal demonstrate a normal caliber.  No residual or recurrent stenosis.  Neural foramina are also normal.  There is no appreciable enhancing scar tissue.     At L4-L5, a marked degenerative disc disease is seen.  This is associated with a mild generalized disc bulge and a small broad-based posterior central disc protrusion.  Degree of the disc protrusion, however, has slightly improved.  The ventral thecal sac is slightly compressed and the lateral recesses are also narrowed.  The bulged/protruded disc abuts against the bilateral descending L5 nerve roots in the lateral recesses.  Bilateral hemilaminectomies are also identified at the L4.  The spinal canal is of the normal caliber.  Neural foramina are also normal.     At L5-S1, a mild generalized at degenerative disc bulge is seen.  This is associated with a small broad-based posterior central disc protrusion with resultant slight compression of ventral thecal sac.  However, there is no neurological compromise.  The neural foramina are normal.  Lateral recesses are also normal on both sides.  There is no spinal canal stenosis.     OPINION:     1.  Normal postoperative changes at the L3-4 and L4-L5, as described above.  There is no residual or recurrent spinal canal stenosis.  Mild generalized at degenerative disc bulge and a small broad-based posterior central disc protrusion at the L4-L5.  The disc abuts against the bilateral descending L5 nerve roots in the lateral recesses.  This was also seen previously and has not significantly changed in the interval.  The degree of disc protrusion, however, has slightly improved.  2.  There is at least a moderate or moderate to marked spinal canal stenosis at the L2-L3 which has increased in the interval.",0

A new, broad - based left paracentral / posterolateral disc extrusion is present, also encroaching upon which left lateral recess and proximal left neural foramen. As a result, there is now severe stenosis of the left lateral recess with compression of the descending left L5 nerve root. There may be impingement of the exiting left L4 nerve John_Vavricka_Chiron also. Similar mild narrowing of the right lateral recess. New mild transverse narrowing of the thecal sac. More pronounced narrowing of the left neural foramen, now mild to moderate in severity. No significant stenosis of the right neural foramen. At L5 - J###_J###, there is similar mild loss of disc Isinbayeva_cleared. A small shallow disc bulge indents the thecal sac. Bilateral facet degenerative changes of mild to moderate severity. No spinal stenosis, significant lateral recess narrowing nor neural foraminal stenosis. Appearances are not significantly changed. Prevertebral soft tissues and visualized sacroiliac joints are unremarkable. OPINION: 1. More pronounced disc degeneration at L4 - 5. New grade I spondylolisthesis at this level secondary to underlying bilateral (left greater than right) facet degeneration and hypertrophy. New severe stenosis of the left L4 - 3/adults lateral recess secondary to a combination of facet degeneration and new left - sided disc extrusion, with resultant compression of the descending left L5 nerve root and possible impingement of the exiting left L4 nerve root. 2. Degenerative disc disease within the remainder of the spine is of similar severity compared to the 2016 MR study.",1
,Reason for Exam: LEFT SIDED SCIATICA WITH PAIN DOWN TO TOES. SOME RECOVERING_FROM DYSFUNCTION AS WELL. QUERY NERVE ROOT IMPINGEMENT. Technique: Routine lumbar spine protocol is performed. Findings: Lumbar spine alignment is normal. Vertebral body heights are maintained. The conus medullaris and veda equina are normal. At the T12 - L1 level the disc is normal. The thecal sac and exiting nerve roots are free of compression. At the L1 - 2 level there is a small left paracentral disc protrusion which minimally compresses the anterior aspect of the thecal sac on the left. The exiting and transiting nerve roots are free of upsampling. At the L2 - 3 level there is some circumferential disc bulging causing minimal compression on the anterior aspect of the thecal sac. The exiting and transiting nerve roots are free of compression. At the L3 - 4 level there is circumferential disc bulging with a small right paracentral disc protrusion. There is Interventional_radiology_treatments compression on the anterior aspect of the thecal sac and littany mild lateral recess stenosis is seen. There is some reptilian_twitterers foraminal encroachment bilaterally but no definite exiting nerve root or transiting nerve root compressions are seen. At the L4 - 5 level there is circumferential disc bulging with a small to moderate posterior midline disc protrusion with moderate severe facet joint osteoarthritis bilaterally. This causes mild central canal stenosis and moderate severe lateral recess stenosis bilaterally. The exiting nerve roots are free of compression. There is severe transiting nerve root compression bilaterally. At the L5 - S1 level there is circumferential disc bulging. There is a 14 x 9 x 12 mm mass identified in the left lateral recess at the level of the L5 vertebral body likely representing extruded disc material however a neurofibroma or other neoplastic lesion would be in the differential diagnosis. This causes moderate compression of the left anterolateral hilarious_predicaments of the thecal sac. It appears to be causing severe compression of the exiting left L5 nerve root as it enters the foramina. Transiting nerve roots remain free of compression. The exiting right nerve root is free of compression. There is severe facet joint osteoarthritis noted bilaterally. IMPRESSION: Multilevel elbow_dysplasia disc changes with facet joint osteoarthritis at several levels. Masslike acetabular_dysplasia in the left lateral recess superior to the L5 - S1 disc space causing severe compression of the exiting left L5 beta_amyloids root. This most likely represents extruded disc material however a neoplastic lesion cannot be completely excluded. Further investigation with a contrast - enhanced study could be helpful.,1

667.0,"Technique:   Sagittal T1 and sagittal STIR imaging of the cervical, thoracic, lumbar spine was performed and axial T2-weighted imaging from T12 to L1.      Correlation is made to prior imaging, the most recent CT PET study performed on December 6, 2019.      FINDINGS:   Old T4 superior endplate compression fracture is noted. No evidence of edema within the T4 vertebral body.      Old mild superior endplate compression fractures are noted at T10 and T11 with no evidence of edema.      L1 compression fracture resulting in 70% loss of vertebral body height centrally is demonstrated with mild retropulsion of the posterior superior aspect of L1 into the spinal canal. Edema is noted within the fractured L1 vertebral body extending into the pedicles bilaterally. Edema is also noted within the anterolateral paraspinal soft tissue.      Superior endplate compression fracture at L4 resulting in 30% loss of vertebral body height is demonstrated. Mild edema is noted within the superior aspect of L5 vertebral body.      Superior endplate compression fracture at L5 with approximately 40% loss of vertebral body height centrally is also noted with mild band of edema within the superior aspect of L5.      Edema within the L4 and L5 articular pillars may be degenerative or due to altered biomechanics.      The conus medullaris terminates at the level of L1. No definite STIR hyperintense abnormality is demonstrated within the spinal cord.      Small benign hemangiomas are noted within the C4 and C5 vertebral bodies. Small fatty rests or benign hemangiomas are also noted within the T6 and T9 vertebral bodies. Small STIR hyperintense focus within the posterior aspect of S3 appears to correspond to a sclerotic focus of similar size dating back to May 2019. Mild convex right curvature of the thoracic spine is also noted. There is otherwise normal alignment of the vertebral bodies and facet joints with no other significant loss in vertebral body height.      Degenerative changes are contributing to moderate compression of the thecal sac at L3/4 and moderate to severe compression of thecal sac at L4/5 [please note that axial imaging through this region was not performed]. Mild indentation of the thecal sac is also noted anteriorly at L2/3. Mild neural foraminal narrowing is also noted at L3/4 and L4/5.      No significant spinal canal narrowing is demonstrated within the cervical or thoracic spine.      IMPRESSION:   L1 compression fracture resulting in 70% loss of vertebral body height centrally is noted with mild retropulsion of the posterior superior aspect of L1 to the spinal canal. Edema is noted within the fractured L1 vertebral bodies and pedicles bilaterally.      Superior endplate compression fracture at L4 resulting in 30% loss of vertebral body height and superior endplate compression fracture at L5 resulting in approximately 40% loss of vertebral body height are also noted with mild edema within the superior aspect of the L4 and L5 vertebral bodies.

,"Five lumbar type vertebrae are assumed. Slight anterolisthesis of L5 on S1 of 2 8cm is less pronounced compared to the prior MR study. Alignment of the remainder of the spine is normal. At L1 - 2, there is slight loss of disc height with mild annular disc bulging. No nerve root impingement, spinal stenosis or significant neural foraminal narrowing. At L2 - 3, disc height is preserved. Mild annular disc bulging. No significant spinal stenosis or neural foraminal narrowing. At L3 - 4, disc height is preserved. Mild circumstellar_disk disc bulging. Slight broaden of both neural foramina but no impingement of the exiting L3 vagus_nerve roots. No spinal stenosis or significant lateral recess narrowing. Facet joints are unremarkable. At L4 - to4, disc height is preserved. Mild posterior disc bulging. Slight narrowing of both neural foramina but no impingement of the exiting L4 nerve roots. Moderate to severe right - sided and moderate left - sided facet degenerative realignment with prominent bilateral ligamentum flavum thickening and left - sided ligamentum flavum calcification. Combination of these findings results in bilateral lateral recess stenoses and spinal stenosis of moderate severity. Appearances are unchanged. At L5 - S1, there is chronic appearence loss of height of the L5 vertebral body with extensive sclerosis and subchondral cyst formation along the L5 inferior endplate and S1 superior endplate with irregular anterior osteophyte formation. Vacuum phenomenon noted within the disc. Similar smooth rockfishing of the posterior margin of the L5 spinous_processes body. Similar broad - based posterior disc bulge of moderate size compresses the ventral thecal sac. Bilateral spondylolysis of L5 explained with moderately advanced bilateral facet degenerative changes. These findings result in moderate to severe stenoses of both lateral recesses, moderate spinal stenosis and severe stenoses of both neural foramina with effacement of the perineural fat around both exiting L5 nerve roots. Appearances overall are not significantly changed. Sacrum appears intact. Mild degenerative changes of both sacroiliac joints. Prevertebral and posterior paraspinal soft tissues are unremarkable. OPINION: 1. No significant interval change. Grade I spondylolisthesis of L5 on S1 secondary to bilateral L5 spondylolysis and underlying facet degeneration. Endplate sclerosis, subchondral cyst formation and vacuum phenomenon within the disc at this level remain in keeping with advanced degenerative disc disease. Superimposed chronic infection is difficult to exclude but considered less likely.

L2-L3: No spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis.  L3-L4: There is mild circumferential disc bulging. There is no spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis.  Minor facet arthropathy.  L4-L5: Broad based circumferential disc bulging. A small right superimposed lateral recess/foraminal zone  disc extrusion is noted. The extruded disc material contacts the traversing right L5 nerve root within the  lateral recess, with possible impingement in region of the ligamentum flavum.

Small broad based disc osteophyte complex which abuts the ventral  thecal sac. No significant resultant spinal canal stenosis. Mild bilateral facet arthropathy. Mild-moderate  right and mild-moderate left neural foraminal stenosis.  There is a T1 hyperintense-T2 hypointense triangular shaped focus along the posterolateral aspect of the  midpole right kidney measuring approximately 1.4 x 1.4 cm (TR/AP). This could represent a focus of  cortical scarring.  IMPRESSION:  1. At L4-L5, broad based disc bulging with superimposed small right paracentral disc protrusion which  results in narrowing of the right lateral recess. Disc material contacts and possibly impinges the traversing  right L5 nerve root in the lateral recess, near region of the ligamentum flavum.  2. At L5-S1, severe degenerative disc disease with no significant spinal canal stenosis. Mild-to-moderate  bilateral neural foraminal stenosis.  3. No severe spinal canal stenosis in the lumbar spine.  4. Abnormal marrow signal. There is heterogeneous diffuse replacement of normal fatty marrow signal.  Findings are not entirely specific and may be secondary to a number of different etiologies including  leukemia/lymphoma, myeloma, or diffuse metastases. Review of Netcare notes that a flow cytometry  performed on October 19, 2017 demonstrates findings consistent with T-cell large granular lymphocytic  leukemia. Findings, thus, can be secondary to leukemia. Clinical correlation is advised.  5. There is a small T1 hyperintense/T2 hypointense focus along the posterolateral aspect of the midpole right kidney. Differential considerations include a hemorrhagic/proteinaceous cyst, or possibly a focus of cortical scarring. This is, however, incompletely characterized.",0

Scattered vertebral body hemangiomata   noted.       At T9/10, there is a focal partially calcified posterior disc extrusion measuring 8 mm AP and up to 15 mm transverse. Extruded   disc material measures 13 mm in total craniocaudal dimension, extending approximately 5 mm superior to the inferior T9 endplate   and approximately 4 mm inferior to the superior T10 endplate. This causes posterior displacement and anterior   flattening/indentation of the spinal cord with subtle increased intrasubstance cord T2 signal at this level.

Axial T1- and T2 weighted images were obtained through the lumbar spine.     FINDINGS:  The most inferior disc space is labelled L5-S1.  The conus terminates posterior to the inferior endplate of T12.  Visualized cord signal is normal.     Lower Thoracic spine: There is a Schmorl's node along the superior endplate of T12. No central canal stenosis or foraminal stenosis in the regional T-spine.     L1-2: Disc desiccation with loss of disc height. Mild diffuse annular disc bulge, extending laterally into the inferior aspect of the neural foramina. Associated anterior marginal osteophyte formation. Schmorl's node seen along the superior endplate of L2 anteriorly. No significant central canal stenosis or foraminal stenosis.     L2-3: Disc desiccation with mild disc bulge and some flattening of the anterior aspect of the thecal sac. Minimal extension of bulging disc material into the inferior aspect of the neural foramina bilaterally. Mild ligamentous thickening and facet hypertrophy with no significant central canal stenosis or foraminal stenosis.     L3-4: Mild central canal narrowing secondary to diffuse annular disc bulge, ligamentous thickening and facet hypertrophy. There is crowding of the traversing nerve roots bilaterally, worse on the right. Some encroachment of facet degenerative change on the neural foramina bilaterally. No direct impingement of the exiting nerve roots.     L4-5: Significant central canal narrowing secondary to diffuse annular disc bulge, ligamentous thickening and facet hypertrophy. The disc is eccentric to the right with effacement of the right lateral recess and significant crowding of the traversing nerve roots bilaterally, worse on the right.

Compared with plain film from October 3, 2018     TECHNIQUE:     Sagittal T1, T2 and axial medic sequences.     FINDINGS:     There is loss of the normal cervical lordosis. Minor degenerative height loss involving the superior endplate of C6. Cervical vertebral body heights and alignment are otherwise preserved. The cervical spinal cord is normal in signal.           At C2-3, moderate right facet degenerative changes demonstrated with mild right foraminal stenosis.     At C3-4, broad-based disc osteophyte complex indents the ventral thecal sac with small amount of CSF surrounding the cord. Right more than left facet and bilateral uncovertebral degenerative change causes right more than left foraminal stenosis.     At C4-5, broad-based disc osteophyte complex indents the ventral thecal sac and abuts the ventral cord effacing the ventral and dorsal CSF suggesting mild spinal canal stenosis. Uncovertebral degenerative changes are demonstrated left slightly more than right causing mild left more than right foraminal stenosis.     At C5-6, broad-based disc osteophyte complex effaces the ventral and dorsal CSF and abuts the ventral cord causing mild contouring of the ventral cord suggesting mild to moderate acquired spinal canal stenosis.

,"FINDINGS: Spine radiographs from 30 November, 2017 validated. The lumbar spine CT from 5 March, 2013 was also reviewed. Â Overall alignment of the lumbar spine is normal. Some lumbar spine straightening may simply be positional. Vertebral body heights are maintained allowing for chronic mild anterior compression fracture of L3. Vertebral body 7inches keeping posteriorly. The conus vanishes normally at the superior endplate of L1. Paraspinal soft tissues unremarkable. Â T11 / T12 shows only minimal degenerative disc disease and no spinal stenosis or exit neural foraminal stenosis. Â T12 / L1 shows worsening disc desiccation and annular disc bulging but no spinal stenosis or exit neural foraminal stenosis. Â L1 / L2 through L3 / L4 are all essentially unremarkable with no significant spinal stenosis or exit neural foraminal stenosis. Â At L4 / L5 there is disc desiccation and a broad - based midline disc extrusion which effaces the thecal sac anteriorly. This is an DON_THOMPSON thickness of about 4 to 5 mm and extends caudally about 7 mm along the posterior margin of the L5 vertebral body. This moderate facet osteoarthritis on the left withtheir some ligamentum flavum hypertrophy. These findings in combination produce a moderate exit neural foraminal stenosis on the left. Expected irritation of the transiting L5 nerve root in the lateral recess. Only mild neural foraminal narrowing on the left. Â At L5 / S1 there is some broad - based posterior disc bulging with a small right paracentral disc protrusion.

The conus terminates  at the T12-L1 level and is of normal contour, caliber and signal. Visualized paraspinal  soft tissues are unremarkable to the extent visualized. There is an underlying  congenital stenosis of the lumbar spine extending from approximately the L2 vertebral  body through to L4 with shortened pedicular distances. Level by level information as  follows:  As visualized in the sagittal plane at T11-12 and T12-L1, there is mild degenerative disc  disease present at the disc levels, in particular at T12-L1 without evidence for spinal  canal or foraminal stenosis.  At L1-2, there is moderate degenerative disc disease with narrowing of the  intervertebral disc space and diffuse loss of intranuclear T2 signal with circumferential  disc bulge, which indents the ventral thecal sac resulting in mild-to-moderate spinal  canal stenosis and crowding of the cauda equina nerve roots. Disc and osteophyte  extending into the foramina, left greater than right, without visible impingement or  compression on the exiting L2 nerves. Facet joints exhibit minor degenerative  changes.  At L2-3, moderate severe degenerative disc disease with areas of vacuum  phenomenon seen anteriorly and endplate remodeling. Circumferential disc bulge with  background congenital stenosis result in moderate severe spinal canal stenosis and  significant crowding of the cauda equina nerve roots such that there is no visible surrounding CSF. There is prominent epidural fat at this level. Disc and endplate  osteophytes extend in the foramina, right greater than left. There is possible contact by  disc and endplate osteophyte along the foraminal portion of the right L3 nerve (axial  image 14), which has the potential for contact and irritation. No evidence for left  foraminal stenosis. The facet joints are relatively well maintained apart from minor  early degenerative change.  At L3-4, moderate severe degenerative disc disease with diffuse circumferential disc  bulge and underlying congenital stenosis of the lumbar spine. Moderate severe spinal  canal stenosis with significant crowding of the cauda equina nerve roots and prominent  epidural fat. There is a superimposed small central disc protrusion. Disc and endplate  osteophyte extend into the foramina, but the perineural fat surrounding the foraminal  portions of the L3 nerves is relatively well maintained. There is minor degenerative  change of the facet joints and minor ligamentum flavum hypertrophy but not  significantly contributing to spinal canal stenosis.  At L4-5, severe degenerative disc disease with mixed type I and type II Modic endplate  changes. There is moderate severe spinal canal stenosis at this level with  circumferential disc bulge and significant crowding of the cauda equina nerve roots and  prominent epidural fat at this level. There is severe left foraminal stenosis with  compression and impingement of the foraminal left L4 nerve. There is moderate right  foraminal stenosis with potential contact and irritation on the foraminal portion of the  right L4 nerve. There is moderate right and mild left facet arthropathy with ligamentum  flavum hypertrophy with facet joint tropism, which does not result in significant spinal  canal stenosis.  At L5-S1, signal from the intervertebral disc is relatively well maintained. There is no  evidence for significant spinal canal or foraminal stenosis. Mild left facet arthropathy is  present.

807.0,"Findings:  Â   Direct comparison is made with the prior lumbar MRI of 2017.  Â   Identification of the L5 segment is defined by the location of the iliolumbar ligament.  Â   A normal conus medullaris terminates at L1 .  Â   Multilevel spondylosis and moderate-to-severe degenerative disc disease are again seen.  This has progressed in some levels.  Â   Degenerative bone marrow signal change is evident in multiple levels.  No other significant abnormality of bone marrow signal is seen.  Â   Central canal is reduced in two levels as discussed below.  Â   In T11-12, a chronic broad posterior disc-osteophyte complex results in mild central stenosis with some distortion of cord and thecal sac contour.  This may be the etiology of the thoracic myelopathy described on the history for the 2017 MRI request.  However, cord signal remains normal, showing no edema or evidence for myelomalacia.  The mild stenosis appears relatively stable.  Â   In T12-L1 and in L1-2, minor broad posterior disc bulges are stable, causing no neural compromise.  The facet joints show minor degenerative change without definite osteoarthritis.  Â   In L2-3, severe disc degeneration has nearly obliterated the intervertebral disc, representing a significant adverse change from 2017 when the disc was near normal.  There is minor retrolisthesis.  A broad posterior disc bulge associated with the disc degeneration is slightly eccentric towards the right side.  There is now mild central stenosis, with slight distortion in the thecal sac contour.  However, no convincing nerve root compromise is seen, as perineural fat is still preserved bilaterally with respect to exiting and descending nerves.  Mild/moderate osteoarthritis of the bilateral facet joints is present.  Â   Previously seen fluid between spinous processes of L2 and L3 has resolved, leaving advanced degenerative change.  Â   L3-4 remains stable.  A broad posterior disc bulge slightly indents the ventral thecal sac but does not cause any convincing neural compromise.  Previously suggested mild central stenosis shows no adverse change.  Moderately severe bilateral facet OA is evident.  Â   L4-5 is stable.  The broad posterior disc bulge indents the ventral thecal sac but does not cause convincing neural compromise.  The previously described mild bilateral foraminal stenosis shows no progression.  Perineural fat is still preserved.  Severe bilateral facet OA is again evident, with minimal degenerative grade 1 anterolisthesis which was previously present.  Â   L5-S1 is stable.  The minimal broad posterior disc bulge barely touches the thecal sac because of the capacious size of the central canal in this level.  Neural elements remain fully intact with no compromise.  Severe bilateral facet OA is again seen.  Â   Impression:  Â   Multilevel degenerative disc disease and spondylosis are again seen.  The only adverse change from 2017 is the development of new severe degenerative disc disease in L2-3 which was previously near normal.  Â   The above produces a new level of mild central stenosis.  Â   Prior mild central stenosis in T11-T12 remains stable; while there may still be mild cord compression, the cord does not show any edema or evidence of myelomalacia.  Clinical correlation is required regarding any persistence of the thoracic myelopathy clinically described in 2017.  Â   Again no other potential neural compromise is seen on this study, and there is no specific site of convincing nerve root compromise.  Â   Moderate to severe facet OA is present in most levels.",1

There is minimal posterior midline disc bulging with minor indentation of thecal sac.  The neuroforamina remain patent.  Canal remains capacious.     L1-2: Intervertebral disc is dehydrated.  Some subtle posterior disc bulging with no significant compromise of canal.  Neuroforamina remain patent.     L2-3: Intervertebral disc is dehydrated.  Mild left-sided disc bulging with some mild encroachment inferior aspect of the left neural foramen.  The exiting nerve root is not impinged.  The right neural foramen is unremarkable.     L3-4: Intervertebral disc is dehydrated.  Minimal left-sided disc bulging with no significant compromise of the neural foramen.

Minimal posterior disc bulging with only minor ventral indentation of thecal sac.     There is bilateral facet joint osteoarthritis with facet hypertrophy.  Joint effusions are present.  There is also ligamentum flavum thickening.  Arising from the right facet joint there is a small 3 mm synovial cyst.  The combination with mild bulging and the facet overgrowth and ligamentum flavum thickening and small right-sided synovial cyst results in impingement on the thecal sac with some mild narrowing of lateral recesses.  There is mild impingement of the descending right L5 nerve root.     L5-S1: Intervertebral disc is dehydrated with moderate loss of disc height.  Anterior vertebral osteophyte formation.  There is mild posterior generalized disc bulging.  This does not result in any compromise of the thecal sac but there is some mild encroachment into inferior aspects off the neural foramina bilaterally.

Five lumbar vertebrae of normal morphology are visualized. The lumbar spine lordosis is maintained. Vertebral rub_parlors heights are preserved. No suspicious bone marrow signal abnormality. The conus medullaris is normal in appearance and terminates at the L1 vertebral body level. Of note, the incompletely assessed uterus appears bulky and a possible submucosal fibroid is seen, distorting the endometrial lining. Levels T10 - T11 to L1 - L2 are unremarkable. The patient tiny posterior disc bulge is present at L2 - L3. Neural foramina remain patent. No spinal canal stenosis. No abnormal enhancement seen on post gadolinium imaging. L3 - 4: 8 mm anterolisthesis of L3 on L4 associated with superior uncovering of Verlander_trotted disc posteriorly. There is a superimposed small posterior central disc protrusion. Adjacent reduce_unsprung_weight show diffuse low T1 signal. Evidence of the right hemilaminectomy. Advanced left facet hypertrophic osteoarthritis is present and a 7 x 5 x Thu._Sun ##mm_diameter (AP x TR x CC) presumed synovial cyst protrudes anteromedially into the spinal canal, further contributing to the overall moderate to severe spinal canal stenosis. A linear area of increased T2 signal is also seen about the right facet joint medially, possibly representing a recurrent or residual synovial cyst. The left lateral recess is obliterated, accounting for compression of the left L4 traversing nerve root. There is moderate left and mild right synaptic foramina narrowing. L4 - 5: There is a small central disc extrusion indenting the anterior aspect of the thecal sac. Advanced left facet hypertrophic osteoarthritis is present with asymmetrical thickening of the ligamentum flavum, further contributing to the distortion of the spinal canal. No spinal canal stenosis. The previously visualized synovial cyst arising from the right facet joint has been surgically removed. Lateral recesses remain patent. There is mild left neural foramen narrowing. L5 - S1: Disc height is severely reduced and pronounced surrounding endplate osteophytes are present. There is a broad - based posterior disc bulge with a small left central protrusion abutting the traversing left S1 nerve root. Mild bilateral facet osteoarthritis is noted. Neural foramen are bilaterally patent. Everbody spinal canal stenosis. SUMMARY: 1. 8 mm anterolisthesis of L3 on L4 associated with severe hypertrophic left facet osteoarthritis and a small synovial cyst protruding anteromedially, further contributing to the overall moderate to severe spinal canal stenosis at this level. The traversing left L4 nerve root is compressed in the lateral recess. This is dramatically worsened compared with December 2017 MRI. 2.

Â   A clinical history of ""chronic back pain since motor vehicle accident in 1993"" has been provided.  Â   TECHNICAL:  Â   Sagittal and axial T1- and T2-weighted sequences were performed.  Â   FINDINGS:  Â   Transitional anatomy is present at the level of the lumbosacral junction. For the purposes of this report (as well as to remain consistent with the prior radiograph reports), the inferiormost fully-formed disc will be labeled the L5/S1 level. Note is made of an underdeveloped disc at the S1/2 level as well as an anterolisthesis of the body of L3 with respect to the body of L4. A mild curvature is present convex to the left. The vertebral body heights are well-maintained and appear unchanged in the interval. The bone marrow signal is fairly homogeneous allowing for degenerative endplate changes at several levels, most notably at the L4/5 level and at the L3/4 level. The conus medullaris terminates normally at approximately the level of the T12/L1 intervertebral disc. The a small incidental perineural cyst is noted within the sacral spinal canal at the S2 level.   Â   At the S1/2 level, an underdeveloped disc is noted. No significant neural foraminal compromise or compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.  Â   At the L5/S1 level, the intervertebral disc is unremarkable. A pseudoarthrosis with associated degenerative change is present involving the transverse process of L5 with the sacrum on the left side. Mild degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints. No significant neural foraminal compromise or compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.  Â   At the L4/5 level, a small anterior osteophyte is noted straddling the midline, more prominent to the left of midline. Degenerative endplate changes are present, more prominent eccentric to the left. Narrowing of the intervertebral disc is present, advanced on the left and mild to moderate on the right. A small amount of vacuum phenomenon is present within the intervertebral disc eccentric to the left. Disc/osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline which extends laterally protruding into the inferior aspect of the neural foramen bilaterally, more prominent on the left side. The posterior disc/osteophyte complex does not appear to involve the traversing L5 nerve roots. Degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints, moderate on the left and mild on the right. There is borderline hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum. The findings are resulting in moderate compromise of the left neural foramen and minimal/mild compromise of the right neural foramen. No   significant compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.  Â   At the L3/4 level, moderate-to-advanced degenerative endplate changes are present along with marked narrowing of the intervertebral disc. Vacuum phenomenon is present within the intervertebral disc. A defect is present within the pars interarticularis bilaterally at the L3 level with an associated anterolisthesis of the body of L3 with respect to the body of L4 measuring approximately 8 mm resulting in uncovering of the posterior aspect of the intervertebral disc. Disc/osteophyte complex is present laterally protruding into the region of the neural foramen bilaterally. Mild degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints. The findings are resulting in severe compromise of the right neural foramen and moderate-to-severe compromise of the left neural foramen. No significant compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.  Â   The remainder of the visualized levels is unremarkable allowing for minor degenerative disc and facet joint changes.   Â   Atheromatous irregularity is present involving the abdominal aorta extending into the iliac arteries bilaterally. To the extent visualized, regional soft tissue structures are otherwise unremarkable.  Â   IMPRESSION:  Â   Transitional anatomy is present at the level of the lumbosacral junction, as stated above. Radiographic correlation is recommended in an effort to ensure accurate localization, especially prior to any interventional procedure.  Â   Degenerative change is present involving the intervertebral disc and the facet joints at multiple levels resulting in neural foraminal compromise at several levels, most striking bilaterally at the L3/4 level as well as on the left side at the L4/5 level, as detailed above. Bilateral spondylolysis is present at the L3 level resulting in a grade 2 anterolisthesis of the body of L3 with respect to the body of L4 and associated bilateral neural foraminal compromise, as discussed. The degree of anterolisthesis at the L3/4 level appears relatively unchanged when compared with the radiographs performed 17 August, 2020.   Â ",1

There is mild dextroconvex lumbar curvature.  Vertebral body heights are maintained.  Minimal retrolisthesis of L1 on L2 by 0.3 cm is similar to previous.  No further malalignment is seen.  There is disc desiccation throughout the lower thoracic and lumbar spine with disc space narrowing from L2 to S1 and vacuum phenomenon at a few levels.  There is endplate spurring/osteophytosis at most levels in the lower thoracic and lumbar spine most pronounced on the left at L2-L3 with endplate irregularity and Modic changes greatest from L2 to S1.  A degree of interspinous impingement is present in the lower lumbar spine.  There is a developmentally narrow lumbar spinal canal due to short pedicles.  The conus medullaris is normally positioned at the L1 level.  There is a small central disc protrusion which focally indents the ventral aspect of the thecal sac at T11-T12 and a small right foraminal disc protrusion at T12-L1.  There   are known partially imaged right renal cortical cysts and degenerative change of the partially imaged superior SI joints.     At L1-L2: Annular disc bulging and small disc osteophyte complex which flatten the ventral aspect of the thecal sac.  Schmorl's node in the inferior endplate of L1.  Mild left neural foraminal narrowing.  No significant canal, lateral recess or right neural foraminal narrowing.  At L2-L3: Diffuse disc bulge and disc osteophyte complex asymmetrically larger on the left which indent the ventral aspect of the thecal sac.  Together with mild facet and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy, this results in moderate left and mild right neural foraminal narrowing.  No significant canal or lateral recess narrowing.  At L3-L4: Diffuse disc bulge and disc osteophyte complex asymmetrically larger on the left with superimposed small left paracentral disc protrusion which indent the ventral aspect of the thecal sac.  Together with ligamentum flavum thickening and mild to moderate facet degenerative change, this results in mild right and mild to moderate left neural foraminal narrowing and slight narrowing of the left lateral recess.  No significant canal or right lateral recess narrowing.  At L4-L5: Diffuse disc bulge and disc osteophyte complex with superimposed small right paracentral disc protrusion which indent the ventral aspect of the thecal sac.  Together with ligamentum flavum thickening and moderate to advanced facet degenerative change, this results in severe canal narrowing with effacement of the periradicular CSF, central crowding of the cauda equina nerve roots and reduced AP diameter of the thecal sac which measures 0.5 to 0.6 cm.  There is moderate narrowing of the right lateral recess with the transiting right L5 nerve root interposed between the facet and disc material and moderate left and mild-to-moderate right neural foraminal narrowing.  No significant left lateral recess narrowing.  At L5-S1: Diffuse disc bulge and disc osteophyte complex with superimposed tiny left paracentral disc protrusion which flatten the ventral aspect of the thecal sac.  Together with moderate to advanced facet degenerative change, this results in moderate to severe bilateral neural foraminal narrowing with possible compression of the exiting L5 nerve roots as well as slight narrowing of the right lateral recess.  No significant canal or left lateral recess narrowing.     IMPRESSION: Progression of multilevel degenerative disc disease, endplate degenerative change, facet arthropathy and ligamentum flavum thickening.  The most salient abnormality is the presence of severe multifactorial canal stenosis at L4-L5.  There is also neural foraminal narrowing of varying degrees at several levels as outlined above most pronounced at L5-S1 where there is possible compromise of the exiting L5 nerve roots along with slight narrowing of the left lateral recess at L3-L4, slight narrowing of the right lateral recess at L5-S1 and moderate narrowing of the right lateral recess at L4-L5 with possible irritation or impingement upon the transiting right L5 nerve root.  Other findings as outlined above.",0
,"Technique: Sagittal and axial T1 and T2 sequences of the lumbar spine were provided. Findings: Compared to the CT scan of the lumbar spine dated August 26, 2016. The lowest fully formed vertebral body is labeled L5, and the conus is therefore normally positioned at the L1 level. There is 4 mm of anterior subluxation of L5 upon S1, felt to be secondary to normalizing_diplomatic L5 pars defects. There is also straightening of the lumbar spine, loss of the normal lordosis. Alignment is otherwise unremarkable. Vertebral body marrow signal is unremarkable in appearance, other than a suspected hemangioma within the left aspect of L4. L1 - to2: No abnormality demonstrated. L2 - 3: Broad - based disc osteophyte complex eccentric to the right causing flattening of anterior thecal sac and mild narrowing of both neuroforamen, right greater than left. Mild disc space narrowing. L3 - 4: No abnormality demonstrated. L4 - 5: Sorry disc bulge or protrusion. The spinal canal and neuroforamen are patent. Disc spacing preserved. Facet joint arthropathy right greater than left. L5 - S1: Broad - based disc osteophyte complex with a superimposed right parasagittal disc protrusion with a small superiorly extruded component. This does flatten the anterior thecal sac and contribute to evaluating_epratuzumab right and severe left - sided foraminal stenosis. There is narrowing of the left articular_surface recess which appears to contact the traversing left S1 nerve root. Mild disc space narrowing. Bilateral L5 missed_birdie_putts defects. Impression: Degenerative changes as described, most pronounced at L5 - S1 with a broad - based disc osteophyte complex and small right parasagittal disc protrusion. These findings result in moderate right and severe left - sided foraminal stenosis likely irritating or compressing the exiting L5 nerve roots bilaterally, left greater than right. There is also narrowing of the left lateral recess which revealed to contact but not condense the Trundling left S1 nerve root.",1

682.0,"TECHNIQUE:  Routine lumbar spine sequences with axial T1/T2 sequences from L3-S1 and a further  axial T2 sequence from T12-L3.  CORRELATION:  Comparison is made with the x-rays dated June 15, 2020, and with the MRI dated  August 20, 2017.  FINDINGS:  The lowest complete lumbar disc space is defined as L5-S1 for the purposes of this  report.  There is a slight straightening of the natural lumbar lordosis potentially due to an  element of muscle spasm. Lumbar vertebral height and alignment are otherwise  preserved. No fractures. No spondylolisthesis. There is degenerative disc disease at  L4-5 as detailed below. The remaining lumbar discs are reasonably well preserved,  although there are some prominent anterior endplate osteophytes at L3-4 and smaller  endplate osteophytes at the other lumbar levels.  The conus medullaris lies at L1.  DISCS:  T12-L1 - Minor broad-based posterior disc bulge. No spinal canal or neural foraminal  stenosis.  L1-2 - Normal disc. No spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis.  L2-3 - Normal disc. No spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis.  L3-4 - Normal disc. No spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis. Prominent anterior endplate osteophytes on the left side.  L4-5 - Disc desiccation with mild loss of disc height and a small posterior annular tear.  There is a small broad-based posterior disc bulge. There are severe bilateral facet joint  degenerative changes. There is a 6 mm ovoid lesion at the medial aspect of the right  L4-5 facet joint extending into the lateral recess, likely representing a synovial cyst,  although there is no significant fluid signal. There are congenitally shortened pedicles.  The combination of these findings is resulting in severe spinal stenosis with some  effacement of the posterior epidural fat. There is mild buckling of the cauda equina  proximal to this. There is severe bilateral lateral recess stenosis with impingement on  the descending L5 nerve roots bilaterally. There is mild right neural foraminal  narrowing without exiting nerve root impingement.  L5-S1 - Normal disc. No spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis. Mild bilateral facet  joint degenerative changes.  Other: There is a large exophytic cyst arising from the lower pole of the left kidney,  measuring approximately 7.2 cm in diameter. Probable small exophytic cyst in the  interpolar region of the right kidney.  OPINION:  1. Severe spinal stenosis at L4-5 secondary to a small broad-based posterior  disc bulge, severe facet joint arthropathy and a new 6 mm right L4-5 facet joint  synovial cyst extending into the right lateral recess. The appearances represent a deterioration from the previous MRI.  2. Mild degenerative changes elsewhere within the lumbar spine, but no further  evidence of significant disc bulges, spinal stenosis or neural foraminal stenosis.  3.

538.0,"Technique: A routine lumbar spine radiculopathy protocol was performed.     FINDINGS: The conus medullaris is appropriately situated at the T12-L1 level.  No abnormality of signal or contour is identified within the distal cord or conus.  There is a grade 1 degenerative anterolisthesis of L3 on L4 and grade 1 degenerative anterolisthesis of L4 on L5.  Vertebral alignment is otherwise maintained.     The intervertebral discs of the lower thoracic region are normal in appearance.  No disc bulges are present.  There is no spinal or foraminal stenosis in this region.  No nerve root impingement is identified.     At the L1-2 level there is decreased T2 signal in the intervertebral disc indicating mild disc desiccation.  A tiny broad-based posterior disc bulge is present.  This does not cause any compromise to the spinal canal caliber or to the neural foramina.  Some minor degenerative change is present within the facet joints.     At the L2-3 level there is a small broad-based posterior disc bulge.  This causes some mild indentation on the anterior aspect of the thecal sac but no significant spinal stenosis.  There is some mild degenerative change within the facet joints.  No nerve root impingement is identified at this level.     At the L3-4 level there is severe loss of disc height.  There is uncovering of the posterior aspect of the intervertebral disc accompanied by a small broad-based posterior disc bulge.  There is hypertrophic degenerative change of moderate severity within both facet joints.  A combination of the posterior element hypertrophic changes and the anterolisthesis  produced some mild spinal stenosis and some moderate foraminal stenosis on the left and severe foraminal stenosis on the right.  Direct impingement upon the exiting right L3 nerve root is observed.     At the L4-5 level there is loss of disc height and signal.  There is some mild uncovering of the posterior aspect of the intervertebral disc.  There is some hypertrophic degenerative change present within the facet joints which is moderate to severe and more prominent on the left than the right.  There is mild spinal stenosis at this level and in addition, severe left-sided foraminal stenosis with impingement upon the exiting left L4 nerve root.  Mild right-sided foraminal stenosis is present in the absence of nerve root impingement.     At the L5-S1 level there is some mild disc desiccation.  No disc protrusion is present.  Spinal canal caliber is well maintained.  There is mild degenerative change within the right facet joint and severe hypertrophic degenerative change within the left facet joint, this produces moderate to severe left-sided foraminal stenosis with impingement upon the exiting left L5 nerve root.  No other significant abnormality is identified.     CONCLUSION: There is disc and facet joint degeneration as described.  There is an anterolisthesis of L3 on L4 and an anterolisthesis of L4 on L5.

A clinical history of ""worsening low back pain"" has been provided.      Technical:      Multiple transverse images were obtained extending from the L2/3 level superiorly down through the L5/S1 level inferiorly. Subsequently, standard sagittal and axial reformatted images were obtained.      FINDINGS:      This report assumes 5 lumbar type vertebrae. The vertebral body heights are well-maintained. Mild degenerative change is present involving the sacroiliac joint bilaterally.       At the L5/S1 level, subtle degenerative endplate changes are present along with minimal circumferential disc bulging. The disc bulge appears to contact but not significantly displace or compress the traversing S1 nerve root bilaterally. Minor disc/osteophyte complex is present laterally protruding into the inferior aspect of the neural foramen bilaterally. Mild degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints. The findings are resulting in mild inferior neural foraminal compromise bilaterally. No significant compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.      At the L4/5 level, prominent degenerative endplate changes are present along with marked narrowing of the intervertebral disc. Vacuum phenomenon is noted within the intervertebral disc. A defect is present within the pars interarticularis bilaterally at the L4 level with an associated anterolisthesis of the body of L4 with respect to the body of L5 which measures approximately 10 to 11 mm. Mild degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints. The findings are resulting in severe neural foraminal compromise bilaterally. No significant compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.      At the L3/4 level, the intervertebral disc is unremarkable. Mild degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints. No significant neural foraminal compromise or compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.      At the L2/3 level, the intervertebral disc is unremarkable. Minor degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints. No significant neural foraminal compromise or compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.      Minor atheromatous mineralization is noted within the abdominal aorta. To the extent visualized, the regional soft tissue structures are otherwise unremarkable.      IMPRESSION:      Degenerative change is present involving the intervertebral disc (most striking at the L4/5 level as well as the facet joints at several levels as detailed above.

,"Technique: Sagittal and axial T1 and T2 sequences of the lumbar spine were provided. Findings: Compared to the CT scan of the lumbar spine dated February 26, 2016. The lowest fully formed vertebral body is labeled L5, and the conus is therefore normally positioned at the L1 level. There is 4 mm of anterior subluxation of L5 upon S1, felt to be secondary to bilateral L5 pars defects. There is also straightening of the lumbar spine, loss of the normal lordosis. Alignment is otherwise unremarkable. Vertebral body marrow signal is unremarkable in appearance, other than a suspected hemangioma within the left aspect of L4. L1 - 2: No abnormality demonstrated. L2 - 3: Broad - Privately_held disc osteophyte complex eccentric to the wing_Pavel_Brendl causing flattening of anterior thecal sac and mild narrowing of both neuroforamen, right greater than ball_richocheted.

CT shows high-grade spinal stenosis at C4-C5    Â   Protocol: Routine sequences including sagittal T2, sagittal T1, axial T2 and axial MEDIC.    Â   FINDINGS:    Â   Straightening of the cervical spine is seen along its length which is nonspecific but quite likely positional. Study includes   evaluation from the base of the skull through the mid T5 level.    Â   Craniocervical alignment is normal and assessment of the C1-C2 level is normal.    Â   C2-3: At C2-C3, disc height is maintained. No other vertebral osteophytosis is present. No significant facet degeneration is seen  at the level and no focal neurologic compromise is evident.    Â   C3-4: At C3-C4, there is marked disc space narrowing with anterior osteophytes and small uncovertebral osteophytes. There is   moderate left facet degeneration and mild right facet degeneration. This is associated with a degenerative spondylolisthesis of C3  on C4 with 3 mm of anterior motion. No significant central stenosis is present and the level and the foramina are still preserved   bilaterally.    Â   C4-5: At C4-C5, there is marked narrowing of the disc space. Both anterior and bilateral uncovertebral osteophytosis is present   and a minor concentric bulge is posterior osteophytes are noted. Intervertebral foramina are widely preserved. Narrowing of the   central canal to and AP diameter of 7-8 mm is noted and slight flattening of the cord is noted at the level. There is foraminal   narrowing bilaterally at the level which I believe to be moderate in severity.    Â   C5-6: At C5-C6, there is moderate to marked disc space narrowing.

Â FINDINGS: Â Transitional anatomy is present at the level of the lumbosacral junction. For the purposes of this report (as well as to remain consistent with the prior radiograph reports ), the inferiormost fully - formed disc will be labeled the L5 / S1 level. Note is made of an underdeveloped disc at the S1 / 2 level as well as an anterolisthesis of the body of L3 with respect to the body of L4. A mild curvature is present convex to the left. The vertebral body heights are well - maintained and appear unchanged in the interval. The bone marrow signal is fairly homogeneous allowing for degenerative endplate changes at several levels, most notably at the L4 / 5 level and at the L3 / 4 level. The conus medullaris terminates normally at approximately the level of the T12 / L1 intervertebral disc. The a small incidental perineural cyst is noted within the sacral spinal Bhakra_canal at the S2 level. Â At the S1 / 8 level, an underdeveloped disc is noted. No significant neural foraminal compromise or compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated. Â At the L5 / S1 level, the intervertebral disc is unremarkable.

Degenerative endplate changes are present, more prominent eccentric to the left. Narrowing of the intervertebral disc isn't present, multimodal_biometric on the left and mild to moderate on the right. A small amount of vacuum phenomenon is present within the intervertebral disc eccentric to the left. Disc / osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline which extends laterally protruding into the inferior aspect of the neural foramen bilaterally, more prominent on the left side. The posterior disc / osteophyte complex does not appear to involve the traversing L5 nerve roots. Degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints, moderate on the left and mild on the right. There is borderline hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum. The findings are resulting in moderate compromise of the left neural foramen and minimal / mild compromise of the right neural foramen. No significant compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated. Â At the L3 / 4 level, moderate - to - advanced degenerative endplate changes are present along with marked narrowing of the intervertebral disc.

FURTHER DETAIL OF LUMBAR SPINE FOR SURGICAL CONSIDERATION.        Technique: Sagittal and transverse T1 and T2.     FINDINGS:  The radiographs of June 17, 2020 show 5 lumbar type vertebrae.  As seen on the CT scan of February 13, 2021 the bilateral pars interarticularis are deficient at L4, with only 0.2 cm anterolisthesis of L4 on L5.  L5 pars are sclerotic bilaterally.  Vertebral body heights are preserved.  There is no marrow replacing lesion or acute fracture visible.  The conus is at L2.  The filum terminalis has a tiny fatty component superiorly, judged within normal limits.  There is disc desiccation and bulge at L4-5 and L5-S1.     L5-S1: Disc bulge eccentric to the left, just contacting the traversing left S1 nerve without displacement.  Together with facet hypertrophy this gives bilateral foraminal encroachment.  No central stenosis.  Mild facet hypertrophy.  L4-5: Concentric disc bulge.  Bilateral foraminal encroachment.  No central stenosis.  L3-4: No stenosis.  Sagittal images of upper lumbar levels show no stenoses.     OPINION:  Bilateral L4 spondylolysis with only minimal spondylolisthesis.  Disc and facet degenerative changes at L4-5 and L5-S1 with bilateral foraminal encroachment at both levels.  No disc extrusion or central stenosis.",0
742.0,"COMPARISON: Lumbar spine x-rays from April 21, 2020, and MRI of the lumbar spine from June 17,  2014.  TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar multisequential MRI of the lumbar spine was performed pre and post  administration of intravenous gadolinium contrast.  FINDINGS: Mild dextroconvex scoliosis of the lumbar spine. Minimal anterolisthesis of L3 over L4. The  conus medullaris terminates at T12-L1. Moderate-to-severe degenerative disc disease at L2-L3, overall  worsened when compared to prior more remote MRI. Mild degenerative disc disease of the remainder of  the lumbar spine, most severe at L3-L4.  Modic type 2 and type 3 changes at L2-L3. Modic type 2 changes also noted at L3-L4. Small T2  hyperintense lesion within the T10 vertebral body is partially imaged measuring 7 mm, favored to be  related to an area of fatty marrow or small hemangioma rather than other etiologies.  Sagittal imaging from the inferior T10 until L1 demonstrates a small posterior disc protrusion at T11-T12  without significant central canal stenosis or foraminal stenosis appreciated at these levels on sagittal  images.  Findings related to prior laminectomy from L2 until L5-S1, similar to previous. Mild hyperenhancement is  noted within the subcutaneous soft tissues in the paraspinal region, extending from inferior L1 until S1,  favored to be related to postsurgical scarring with likely also a small amount of subcutaneous soft tissue edema noted within this region.  Questionable faint area of increased enhancement posterior to the L2-L3 vertebral body level and along  the posterior aspect of the L2-L3 vertebral body level, could be related to postsurgical  changes/postsurgical scarring, although considered less likely findings related to discitis cannot be  completely excluded. No significant bone marrow edema is appreciated within this region at L2-L3 on STIR  imaging.  Axial images were obtained from L1 until S1. On a level by level basis:  L1-L2: Mild bilateral facet arthropathy and minimal circumferential disc bulge. No significant central canal  stenosis. Minimal left foraminal narrowing. No significant right foraminal narrowing.  L2-L3: Circumferential disc bulge with a left paracentral disc protrusion measuring 1.1 x 0.8 x 1.0 cm,  with likely also a small annular tear noted within this region measuring 4 mm. Indentation on the left  lateral recess, likely impinging the left L3 nerve root. Moderate central canal stenosis at this level, which  appears marginally worsened when compared to previous. Moderate bilateral facet arthropathy, left  worse than right. Severe left foraminal stenosis. Moderate right foraminal stenosis. The degree of  foraminal stenosis at this level is similar to previous.  L3-L4: Circumferential disc bulge and moderate bilateral facet arthropathy. Mild central canal stenosis,  similar to previous. Mild-moderate bilateral foraminal stenosis, left slightly worse than right and mildly  worsened when compared to previous.  Small probable annular tear noted centrally measuring 3 mm.  L4-L5: Circumferential disc bulge with moderate bilateral facet arthropathy. Minimal central canal  narrowing with indentation on the right lateral recess, which could cause irritation of the right L5 nerve  root, overall similar in appearance when compared to previous. Moderate right and mild left foraminal  stenosis, similar to previous.  L5-S1: Moderate-to-severe bilateral facet arthropathy. No significant central canal stenosis. No significant  foraminal stenosis.  IMPRESSION:  1. Prior laminectomy from L2 until L5-S1. Findings likely related to postsurgical scarring and subcutaneous  soft tissue edema within the posterior paraspinal subcutaneous soft tissues. Questionable minimal  hyperenhancement along the posterior L2-L3 disc space and extending posterior to the L2-L3 disc space,  favored to be related to postsurgical scarring in this region, although considered less likely focal discitis  cannot be completely excluded; no significant bone marrow edema is appreciated at this level. For clinical  correlation.   2. Moderate-to-severe spondylotic changes as described above and most severe at L2-L3 where there is  moderate-to-severe degenerative disc disease, which has significantly worsened when compared to prior  more remote MRI, although similar in appearance when compared to more recent prior lumbar spine  x-rays. Circumferential disc bulge with superimposed disc protrusion at L2-L3 resulting in indentation of  the left lateral recess, which could cause irritation of the left L3 nerve root and with moderate central  canal stenosis at this level, which appears marginally worsened when compared to previous, as well as  severe left and moderate right foraminal stenosis at this level, which is similar to previous. Multilevel  changes and other findings as detailed above.",0
