FINDINGS: MRI CERVICAL SPINE: There is normal alignment of the vertebral bodies and facet joints with no significant loss in vertebral body height. No definite abnormal T2 high signal is demonstrated within the cervical spine. 2 / 3: No significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing. C3 / 4: No significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing. C4 / 5: No significant spinal canal or synaptic foraminal narrowing. C5 / 6: Minimal disc osteophyte complex is noted with no significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing. C6 / 7: No significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing. C7 / T1: No significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowed. 12 x 9 mm T2 hyperintense focus within the subcutaneous soft tissue of the back on the left at the level of C6 / 7 may represent a sebaceous cyst. MRI LUMBAR SPINE: 4 lumbar - type vertebrae are noted. Fatty endplate degenerative changes are noted at L4 / 5. Concave - like depression of the inferior endplate of L5 is unchanged dating back to the CT study of February 2008. There is otherwise normal alignment of the vertebral bodies and facet joints with no other significant loss in vertebral body height. The conus medullaris terminates at the level of T12 / D_Pad and is within normal limits in appearance. No significant degenerative disc changes, spinal canal narrowing or neural foraminal narrowing at T12 / L1_R1, L1 / 2, or L2 / 3. L3 / 4: Disc protrusion is noted centered to the left of the midline indenting the thecal sac with moderate compression of the thecal sac. The left traversing L4 nerve root is being contacted and appears to be getting flattened against the ligamentum flavum. No significant neural foraminal narrowing. L4 / 5: Disc bulge is noted with a broad - based posterior disc protrusion that is contacting the traversing L5 nerve roots, left greater than right. Mild spinal canal narrowing it'sa noted with no significant neural foraminal narrowing. L5 / S1: Small broad - based posterior disc protrusion is noted centered to the right of the midline minimally contacting the traversing S1 nerve roots. No significant spinal canal narrowing. Posterolateral osteophytosis is contributing to mild neural foraminal narrowing. Fetal lobulations may account for the slightly lobulated appearance of the left kidney on the localizer images. This can be confirmed with ultrasound. IMPRESSION: Degenerative changes within the lumbar spine as described above. At L3 / 4, disc protrusion is resulting in moderate compression of the thecal sac and the left traversing L4 nerve root appears to be getting flattened against the ligamentum flavum. At L4 / 5, the traversing L5 nerve roots are being contacted, left greater than right, with mild spinal canal narrowing overall. At L5 / S1, minimal contact of the traversing S1 nerve roots is noted with mild neural foraminal narrowing. No significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing is demonstrated within the cervical spine. Fetal lobulations may account for the significantly lobulated appearance of the left kidney on the localizer images. Correlation with ultrasound is recommended. 12 x 9 mm T2 hyperintense focus within the subcutaneous soft tissue of the back on the left at the level of C6 / 7 may represent a sebaceous cyst."

11,,1,"As noted before, there is evidence of the tethered cord and the spinal cord extends to the S1 level where it is tethered posteriorly. No evidence of any lipoma nor any other abnormality in the spinal canal. The L1 - L2 disc space is slightly reduced and this is associated with a mild disc desiccation and a quite small posterior central annular tear which is causing a slight generalized disc bulge. This is a new finding. No evidence of disc protrusion. Even ventral thecal sac is minimally compressed but the spinal cord is normal. At L2 - L3, moderate degree generalized degenerative disc bulge and disc desiccation are seen along with the slight reduction in the disc space. â_€_œIn addition, there is a mild to moderate size posterior - central and left parasagittal disc extrusion. The extruded disc measures 1. 2 cm in the transverse and 6 mm in AP dimensions.

X-RAYS DONE 2017 SHOWED MILD-TO-MODERATE DISC HEIGHT NARROWING AT L5-S1. HE ALSO HAS HISTORY OF THORACIC SCOLIOSIS. POSITIVE SLR. URGENT     COMPARISON: Previous x-ray May 2/17 (Hardisty Heatlh Centre).     TECHNIQUE: Routine non-augmented L-spine radiculopathy protocol.     FINDINGS:  5 lumbar type vertebral bodies are identified, as on prior plain radiograph. Conus medullaris is therefore noted to terminate normally at L1. There is limited visualization of the thoracolumbar junction. However, very minimal anterior wedging is seen. Schmorl's nodes are noted involving the superior and inferior endplates of T12, as well as the superior endplate of L1. This may relate to congenital Scheuermann's disease.     T11-12 demonstrates loss of disc height. Minimal posterior disc osteophyte complex is seen, along with mild degenerative facet joint change bilaterally. No stiffness stenosis results at this level.     T12-L1 demonstrates mild degenerative facet joint change bilaterally. No significant stenosis seen.     L1-2 and L2-3 are unremarkable, as assessed on sagittal sequences. No significant stenosis seen.     L3-4 demonstrates minimal degenerative facet joint change on the left. No stenosis seen at this level.     L4-5 demonstrates a small left paracentral disc protrusion and associated annular tear. T2 bright material is seen extending from the left paracentral annular tear inferior to the disc level. This extends into the right lateral recess measuring approximately 4 x 8 x 9 mm (AP x T x CC) in size. This is favored to represent sequelae of a sequestered disc fragment, and is compressing the traversing right L5 nerve root within the lateral recess. Mild degenerative facet joint changes are seen bilaterally. There is minimal stenosis of the left lateral recess also noted at this level. No other significant stenosis seen.     L5-S1 demonstrates a small central disc protrusion. In addition, there is a small 7 mm disc fragment seen to the right of midline just above this level. This is probably another small sequestered disc fragment. This may be coming from the L5-S1 disc, or possibly from the L4-5 disc above. In any event, this disc fragment is compressing the right L5 nerve root just prior to entering the right neural foramen. Mild degenerative facet joint changes are seen bilaterally. No other significant stenosis seen at this level.     IMPRESSION: Sequestered disc fragment within the right lateral recess at L4-5, probably arising from the L4-5 disc level. This is compressing the traversing right L5 nerve root. Additional sequestered disc fragment just inferior to this, also compressing the right L5 nerve root just before it enters the neural foramen at L5-S1."

Technique: Sagittal T1 and T2 and axial T2-3-D medic sequences of the thoracic spine were performed. Additionally, sagittal and axial T1 and T2 sequences of the lumbar spine were also provided.     Findings:     Compared to plain films dated July 20, 2017, as well as a previous MRI of the lumbar spine dated May 11, 2016..     The visualized spinal cord demonstrates a normal appearance with no altered signal or evidence of syrinx. The conus is normally positioned at the L1 level. There is a marked S-shaped rotatory scoliosis noted convex to the right within the mid thoracic spine and convex to the left within the mid lumbar spine. Vertebral body marrow signal is unremarkable, other than degenerative endplate changes at the L2-3 level.     Within the thoracic spine, there is no focal disc bulge or protrusion identified. The spinal canal is widely patent. Neuroforamen are unremarkable in appearance with no evidence of exiting nerve root compromise.     L1-2: No disc bulge or protrusion. The spinal canal and neuroforamen are patent. Mild disc space narrowing.     L2-3: Broad-based disc osteophyte complex eccentric to the right, with no significant canal stenosis however associated moderate right-sided foraminal stenosis. The left-sided neural foramen is patent. Mild disc space narrowing. Bilateral facet joint arthropathy right greater than left.     L3-4: Broad-based disc osteophyte complex causing mild flattening of the anterior thecal sac. Neuroforamen are patent bilaterally. Disc spacing preserved. Bilateral facet joint arthropathy.     L4-5: Mild broad-based disc osteophyte complex causing mild flattening of anterior thecal sac. There is also marked bilateral facet joint arthropathy left greater than right which contributes to moderate left-sided foraminal stenosis. The right-sided neural foramen is patent. Mild disc space narrowing. There is associated effacement of the left lateral recess with suspected compression of the traversing left L5 nerve root.     L5-S1: Broad-based disc osteophyte complex eccentric to the left causing minimal flattening of anterior thecal sac. This contributes to moderate left-sided foraminal stenosis and effacement of the left lateral recess with contact or mild compression of the traversing left S1 nerve root. The right-sided neural foramen and lateral recess are patent. Mild facet joint arthropathy. Mild disc space narrowing.     Impression:     Severe rotoscoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine as described. There is however no focal degenerative disc disease within the thoracic spine with no evidence of significant spinal canal stenosis or evidence of exiting nerve root compression.     Multifocal degenerative changes within the lumbar spine most pronounced at the L4-5 and L5-S1 levels, with effacement of the left lateral recess at both levels likely contributing to traversing left L5 and S1 nerve root compression. There is also moderate left-sided foraminal stenosis at both levels which may contribute exiting left L4 and L5 nerve root irritation or compression. These findings however have not changed appreciably since the MRI of May 2016."

No evidence of any lipoma nor any other abnormality in the spinal canal.     The L1-L2 disc space is slightly reduced and this is associated with a mild disc desiccation and a quite small posterior central annular tear which is causing a slight generalized disc bulge.  This is a new finding.  No evidence of disc protrusion.  The ventral thecal sac is minimally compressed but the spinal cord is normal.     At L2-L3, moderate degree generalized degenerative disc bulge and disc desiccation are seen along with the slight reduction in the disc space.  In addition, there is a mild to moderate size posterior-central and left parasagittal disc extrusion.  The extruded disc measures 1.2 cm in the transverse and 6 mm in AP dimensions.  It extends slightly below the level of the disc space and is causing narrowing of the left lateral recess where the left L3 nerve root is impinged.

There is very minimal curvature of the lower lumbar spine convex to the right.  Lumbar vertebral body heights and alignment are otherwise preserved.  Multilevel endplate degenerative changes are noted primarily at L2-3, L4-5 and L5-L6.  The conus tip is normal at the inferior aspect of L1.      Only minimal degenerative changes are demonstrated at T10-11, T11-12 and T12-L1.  No spinal canal stenosis at any of these levels.

There is mild dextroconvex lumbar curvature.  Vertebral body heights are maintained.  Minimal retrolisthesis of L1 on L2 by 0.3 cm is similar to previous.  No further malalignment is seen.  There is disc desiccation throughout the lower thoracic and lumbar spine with disc space narrowing from L2 to S1 and vacuum phenomenon at a few levels.  There is endplate spurring/osteophytosis at most levels in the lower thoracic and lumbar spine most pronounced on the left at L2-L3 with endplate irregularity and Modic changes greatest from L2 to S1.  A degree of interspinous impingement is present in the lower lumbar spine.  There is a developmentally narrow lumbar spinal canal due to short pedicles.  The conus medullaris is normally positioned at the L1 level.  There is a small central disc protrusion which focally indents the ventral aspect of the thecal sac at T11-T12 and a small right foraminal disc protrusion at T12-L1.  There   are known partially imaged right renal cortical cysts and degenerative change of the partially imaged superior SI joints.     At L1-L2: Annular disc bulging and small disc osteophyte complex which flatten the ventral aspect of the thecal sac.  Schmorl's node in the inferior endplate of L1.  Mild left neural foraminal narrowing.  No significant canal, lateral recess or right neural foraminal narrowing.  At L2-L3: Diffuse disc bulge and disc osteophyte complex asymmetrically larger on the left which indent the ventral aspect of the thecal sac.  Together with mild facet and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy, this results in moderate left and mild right neural foraminal narrowing.  No significant canal or lateral recess narrowing.  At L3-L4: Diffuse disc bulge and disc osteophyte complex asymmetrically larger on the left with superimposed small left paracentral disc protrusion which indent the ventral aspect of the thecal sac.  Together with ligamentum flavum thickening and mild to moderate facet degenerative change, this results in mild right and mild to moderate left neural foraminal narrowing and slight narrowing of the left lateral recess.  No significant canal or right lateral recess narrowing.  At L4-L5: Diffuse disc bulge and disc osteophyte complex with superimposed small right paracentral disc protrusion which indent the ventral aspect of the thecal sac.  Together with ligamentum flavum thickening and moderate to advanced facet degenerative change, this results in severe canal narrowing with effacement of the periradicular CSF, central crowding of the cauda equina nerve roots and reduced AP diameter of the thecal sac which measures 0.5 to 0.6 cm.  There is moderate narrowing of the right lateral recess with the transiting right L5 nerve root interposed between the facet and disc material and moderate left and mild-to-moderate right neural foraminal narrowing.  No significant left lateral recess narrowing.  At L5-S1: Diffuse disc bulge and disc osteophyte complex with superimposed tiny left paracentral disc protrusion which flatten the ventral aspect of the thecal sac.  Together with moderate to advanced facet degenerative change, this results in moderate to severe bilateral neural foraminal narrowing with possible compression of the exiting L5 nerve roots as well as slight narrowing of the right lateral recess.  No significant canal or left lateral recess narrowing.     IMPRESSION: Progression of multilevel degenerative disc disease, endplate degenerative change, facet arthropathy and ligamentum flavum thickening.  The most salient abnormality is the presence of severe multifactorial canal stenosis at L4-L5.  There is also neural foraminal narrowing of varying degrees at several levels as outlined above most pronounced at L5-S1 where there is possible compromise of the exiting L5 nerve roots along with slight narrowing of the left lateral recess at L3-L4, slight narrowing of the right lateral recess at L5-S1 and moderate narrowing of the right lateral recess at L4-L5 with possible irritation or impingement upon the transiting right L5 nerve root.

The disc protrusion impinges the descending left L4 nerve root.  No significant encroachment into the neural foramen.  The descending right L4 nerve root is not compromised.  Right neural foramen is patent.     L4-5: Intervertebral disc is dehydrated.  There is moderate loss of the disc height.  Posterior broad-based disc bulging extending across the posterior margin of the disc.  Along the midline and right parasagittal aspect the disc is more prominent with moderate sized protrusion.  The disc impinges upon the thecal sac.  The disc encroaches into the right lateral recess space with mild impingement of the descending right L5 nerve root.  The disc protrusion also encroaches into the entrance to the right neural foramen.  The exiting L4 nerve root is not impinged.  The disc bulging also has minor encroachment into inferior aspect of the left neural foramen with no significant compromise of the exiting L4 nerve root.     L5-S1: Intervertebral disc is dehydrated.  A focal small right parasagittal disc protrusion which impinges the descending right S1 nerve root.  The descending left S1 nerve root is not compromised.  Neuroforamina remain patent.     Vertebral alignment is normal.  Vertebral body heights are maintained.     Lumbar facet joints are unremarkable.     SUMMARY:     There is potential for nerve root irritation at the L3-4, L4-5 and L5-S1 levels as described.  Correlation with the distribution of symptoms is suggested to assess the most clinically significant nerve root impingements.  On MR imaging these are at L3-4 the descending left L4 nerve root, at L4-5 the descending right L5 nerve root, and L5-S1 the descending right S1 nerve root."

Lower thoracic canal / foramina are patent. L1 - 2 disc shows mild right posterolateral annular bulging. The L1 nerve roots exit normally. The canal is patent. Mild degenerative facet joint overgrowth. The L2 - 3 disc shows degenerative osteophytic lipping with circumferential bulging that indents the ventral thecal sac and caudally narrows intervertebral foramina. The L2 nerve roots exit normally. Mild degenerative facet joint overgrowth. Central canal remains prop_erly patent. L3 - S1 discs show degenerative signal loss, narrowing, osteophytic lipping; with small circumferential disc osteophyte complexes that indent the ventral thecal sac and caudally narrow the intervertebral foramina. Further degrees of degenerative facet joint overgrowth, more advanced at L4 - 5. Degenerative facet joint overgrowth at L3 - 4 indents the posterolateral thecal sac and narrows the transverse dimension of the River_Irwell such that posterior epidural fat indents the posterior thecal sac. Discopathy indents the innervation thecal sac. Constellation of features results in moderate / marked stenosis of the thecal sac, its anteroposterior dimension reduced to about 5 - 6 mm in the midline. Lateral recess inlets are markedly narrowed. Attenuation of CSF and crowding of the cauda. Attenuated fat planes remain visible adjacent the exiting L3 nerve roots. Grade 1 anterolisthesis of the L3 vertebral body on L4 of about 4 mm. Uncovering of by posterior annulus with marked caudal narrow of intervertebral foramina. Advanced overgrowth of the facet joints narrows the transverse dimension of the canal, a small posterior epidural fat pad indenting the posterior thecal sac. Marked stenosis of the thecal sac, its anteroposterior and mediolateral dimensions reduced to a few millimeters. Attenuated fat airliner remain visible adjacent the exiting L4 nerve roots. Effacing of CSF and crowding of the cauda. Attenuated kilojoules planes remain visible adjacent the exiting L4 nerve roots. L5 - S1 disc shows Moderate_Alzheimer_Disease broad - based posterior annular bulging that indents the ventral thecal sac. Central canal remains adequately patent. Traversing S1 nerve roots normal and symmetrical. Some caudal narrowing of intervertebral foramina, the L5 nerve roots continuing to exit normally. Mild / moderate degenerative facet joint overgrowth. Opinion: Multilevel degenerative changes as detailed. Grade 1 L4 spondylolisthesis. Discopathy / facetopathy results in marked stenosis of the thecal sac at L4 - 5, and somewhat lesser stenosis of the thecal sac at L3 - 4. Surgical consultation may be prudent."

Alignment is normal. Vertebral body heights are maintained. Marrow signal is unremarkable. Mild degenerative changes within the inferior endplate of L5. Prevertebral soft tissues are unremarkable.     Conus medullaris is normal, terminating at the upper L2 level. No fatty filum terminale.     The T11-12, T12-L1, L1-2 and L2-3 discs are unremarkable. No spinal stenosis or neural foraminal stenosis at these levels.     At L3-4, disc height is preserved. Hypointense T2 disc signal reflects disc degeneration. A small shallow central disc protrusion with tiny annular fissure indents the thecal sac. No nerve root impingement, spinal stenosis or neural foraminal stenosis. Facet joints are unremarkable.     At L4-5, disc height is maintained. Diffuse hypointense T2 disc signal noted. A small shallow central disc protrusion mildly indents the ventral thecal sac. A 7 mm T2 hyperintense annular fissure is present within the protruded disc. No impingement of the descending or exiting nerve roots. No spinal stenosis, neural foraminal stenosis or significant lateral recess narrowing. Facet joints are unremarkable. Mild ligamentum flavum thickening.     At L5-S1, disc height is maintained. Diffuse hypointense T2 disc signal noted. There is a small broad-based central disc extrusion, extending inferiorly by approximately 4 mm. Subtle T2 hyperintensity within it likely represents an annular fissure. It abuts but does not significantly compress either descending S1 nerve root. Subtle hypointense T1/hyperintense T2 signal is noted within the ventral epidural space on the left side, just inferior to the disc. This is suspicious for a small fragment of extruded/sequestered disc. It abuts but does not displace the descending left S1 nerve root. No spinal stenosis. Minor narrowing of both neural foramina. Facet joints are unremarkable.     OPINION:  1. Small disc protrusions with annular fissures at L3-4 and L4-5 do not cause any nerve root impingement.     2. Small central disc extrusion at L5-S1 with suspected small extruded/sequestered disc fragment extending inferiorly on the left, adjacent to the descending left S1 nerve root. No significant displacement or compression of the nerve root is evident.     3. No spinal stenosis or significant neural foraminal narrowing at any level."

103,403.0,0,"Narrative & Impression  MR LUMBAR SPINE      Reason for Exam: PATIENT HAS BACK PAIN THAT RADIATES DOWN BACK OF LEFT LOWER LEG. MISSING KNEE REFLEX ON LEFT. QUERY LEFT-SIDED SCIATICA.     HISTORY:  As above.     TECHNIQUE:  Standard radiculopathy protocol, consisting of sagittal T1 and T2 imaging from T11-12 to the mid sacrum and axial T1 and T2 imaging from L3-4 to L5-S1.     FINDINGS:  Comparison made to the MR lumbar spine from January 28, 2015 (Royal Alexandra Hospital) and lumbar spine x-rays from October 11, 2018 (Insight Medical Imaging).     Five lumbar vertebrae are assumed. Similar minimal curvature of the lumbar spine convex left. Vertebral body heights are maintained. Similar mild degenerative endplate changes noted ventrally at the L2-3 level, associated with small osteophytes. No marrow abnormalities of concern in the remainder of the spine.     Conus medullaris is normal, terminating at the L1 level.     No significant disc bulging or herniation noted at the T11-12, T12-L1 or L1-2 levels.     At L2-3, there is a small annular disc bulge indenting the thecal sac but not causing any nerve root impingement. Slight narrowing of both neural foramina but no impingement of the exiting L2 nerve roots. No spinal stenosis.     At L3-4, disc height is maintained. A small annular disc bulge is present, mildly indenting the thecal sac and slightly encroaching upon the inferior aspect of both neural foramina, but not causing any focal nerve root impingement. No significant facet degenerative changes. No spinal stenosis or lateral recess stenosis.     At L4-5, disc height is maintained. Mild annular disc bulging is present, resulting in slight encroachment upon the inferior aspect of both neural foramina but no impingement of the exiting L4 nerve roots. Mild bilateral facet degenerative changes. No spinal stenosis or lateral recess narrowing.     At L5-S1, there is slight loss of disc height with diffuse hypointense T2 disc signal indicative of disc degeneration. A small shallow central disc-osteophyte complex abuts the thecal sac. The small posterolateral disc extrusion situated paracentrally on the left, protruding inferiorly, demonstrated on the previous MR study, has almost completely resolved. A tiny residual/recurrent left posterolateral disc protrusion remains, indenting but not displacing the descending left S1 nerve root. The left S2 nerve root is no longer compressed. Similar mild stenosis of the left neural foramen. Right neural foramen remains of reasonable caliber. Similar mild degenerative changes of both facet joints. No spinal stenosis.     Visualized sacroiliac joints are unremarkable. Prevertebral soft tissues are unremarkable.     OPINION:  Previously demonstrated left-sided disc extrusion/sequestration at L5-S1 is no longer evident. A tiny left posterolateral disc protrusion remains at this level, indenting the descending left S1 nerve root within the lateral recess. No new superimposed abnormality. No spinal stenosis at any level.     _____________________________________________________________  Electronically Verified by Sandeep Naik on 11/12/2018 6:16 PM"

There is narrowing of the C5-6 intervertebral disc.  Annular bulging and broad-based posterior protrusion with posterior marginal osteophytes.  Combined disc osseous complex encroach on the central canal with encroachment on the adjacent spinal cord.  Unfortunately signal intensity is not optimal at this level but there is some degree of flattening of the cervical spinal cord.  No obvious myelomalacia.     There is minor compression fracture involving the superior endplates of T4 with no associated marrow edema likely long-standing.  There is fusion anteriorly at the T10-T11 level with a rudimentary disc interspace posteriorly.  The alignment of the posterior margins the vertebral bodies is maintained.  There is alteration the signal intensity associated with the T10 and T11 vertebral bodies and there are Modic endplate changes present at the T9-10 level as well as at the T12-L1 level.      T7-8 level: Shallow central posterior protrusion of the T7-8 intervertebral disc with minor encroachment on the anterior aspect of the thecal sac but no compression of the adjacent spinal cord.     T8-9 level: There is narrowing and desiccation of the T8-9 intervertebral disc.  There is a large central posterior protrusion of the T8-9 intervertebral disc.  Again there is encroachment on the central canal and there is some degree of encroachment on the spinal cord at this level with associated flattening.  There is some degree of thinning of the spinal cord at the T8-9 and T9-10 levels.     T9-10 level: There is narrowing and desiccation of the T9-10 intervertebral disc.  There is focal protrusion of the T9-10 intervertebral disc identified and there is a large calcific or ossific body arising centered on the disc interspace.  This measures approximately 10 x 9 x 14 mm.  There is significant encroachment on the central canal and there is flattening of the spinal cord.  Very minor increased signal intensity identified suggesting minor myelomalacia.  There is also facet joint hypertrophy at the T9-10 level.     T11-12 and T12-L1 levels: Minor narrowing and desiccation of these intervertebral discs.  Borderline bulging of the T12-L1 intervertebral disc.  No nerve root impingement.     L1-2 level: Desiccation of the L1-2 intervertebral disc identified.  There is bulging and broad-based posterior protrusion of the L1-2 intervertebral disc more pronounced towards the right.  Facet joint hypertrophy.  There is bilateral lateral recess stenosis at this level more pronounced on the right and there is bilateral neural foraminal stenosis again right greater than left.     L2-3 level: There is desiccation of the L2-3 intervertebral disc with annular bulging and broad-based posterior protrusion more pronounced towards the right.  Facet joint hypertrophy.  I do suspect lateral recess stenosis at this level.  Additional imaging of the lumbar spine recommended.     IMPRESSION: There is incomplete segmentation or fusion of the anterior aspect of the T10 and T11 vertebral bodies with rudimentary T10-11 intervertebral disc posteriorly.  Likely developmental.     There is shallow central posterior protrusion at the T7-T8 intervertebral disc with mild encroachment on the thecal sac.  Large central posterior protrusion of the T8-9 intervertebral disc with encroachment on the central canal with mild compression of the spinal cord with associated thinning.     Large posterior protrusion T9-10 intervertebral disc with calcified disc material posteriorly encroaching on the central canal with marked central stenosis and compression of the adjacent spinal cord with minimal myelomalacia.     Additional disc degenerative changes within the cervical and lumbar spine with central stenosis at the C5-6 level and lateral recess stenosis at the L1-2 and L2-3 levels.  Additional imaging of the cervical and lumbar spine recommended.

Conus appears to terminate at T12. T12-L1 disc is normal.     Lumbar vertebral body heights are maintained with no malalignment. Degenerative osteophytic lipping at multiple lumbar disc levels. Mild degenerative overgrowth of the lumbar facet joints.     Right paracentral disc protrusion/extrusion at L1-2, with displacement of disc material along the posterior cortex of the L1 vertebral body contained by the PLL and tapering near the superior endplate. Corresponding indentation of the right ventral thecal sac with some narrowing of the right lateral recess inlet and mild asymmetric narrowing of the canal overall. The L1 nerve roots exit normally.     L2-3 and L3-4 discs are normal.     The L4-5 disc shows degenerative signal loss, osteophytic lipping, mild/moderate narrowing, and early Modic endplate signal alteration. Broad-based posterior annular bulging mildly indents the ventral thecal sac with caudal narrowing of the left intervertebral foramen. A thinned epidural fat plane remains visible adjacent the exiting left L4 nerve root. The right L4 nerve root exits normally. Central canal remains reasonably patent.     The L5-S1 disc is narrow without focal asymmetric protrusion. Canal and foramina are patent. Vestigial S1-2 disc. Visualized upper sacral canal/foramina are patent.     Opinion:     Right paracentral disc protrusion/extrusion at L1-2, possibly with irritation of the transitioning right L1 nerve root.     Broad-based posterior annular bulging at L4-5.

125,610.0,0,"TECHNIQUE: MRI of the lumbar spine was performed utilizing sagittal T1, T2, and STIR sequences through the entire lumbar spine, with axial T1 and T2 sequences through the lower 3 disc levels.     FINDINGS: Comparison is made to lumbar spine x-rays from October 07, 2019 and June 04, 2011.  These x-rays demonstrate 5 lumbar type vertebral bodies, as well as a cyst with a sclerotic margin along the posterior portion of the L4 vertebral body.     The MRI also demonstrates a cyst within the posterior aspect of the L4 vertebral body, along its left aspect.  This cyst measures 1.5 cm craniocaudad by 1 cm AP by 0.9 cm transverse, and appears stable when compared to the prior x-rays.  The MRI also demonstrates a low T1 and T2 signal intensity rim, consistent with the sclerosis on the x-rays.  This is associated with endplate irregularity along the superior aspect of the L4 vertebral body, which suggests that this is degenerative in etiology.  There is a small amount of fibrovascular endplate degenerative changes along the posterior left aspect of the L5-S1 level, preferentially involving the L5 endplate.  There is also evidence of extensive fatty endplate degenerative changes along the anterior aspect of the L4-L5 level.  Anterior osteophytes at multiple levels, preferentially at the L4-L5 level.     The visualized portion of the retroperitoneum is within normal limits.  The paraspinous musculature is unremarkable.  The conus medullaris is normal in appearance, and terminates normally at approximately the L1-L2 disc level.     The visualized portion of the lower thoracic spine and the upper lumbar spine demonstrate relatively normal discs, with no significant spinal canal/neural foraminal narrowing.     L3-L4: There is mild degenerative disc disease, with loss of normal disc signal, endplate irregularity, tiny anterior osteophytes, and subtle loss of disc height.  The cyst within the L4 vertebral body has been described previously.  There is also a tiny right foraminal disc protrusion that results in mild right inferior neural foraminal narrowing, but no evidence of compression of the exiting right L3 nerve root.  No significant spinal canal narrowing at this level.  No significant facet arthropathy.     L4-L5: There is moderate degenerative disc disease, with moderate loss of disc height, loss of disc signal, fatty endplate degenerative change, anterior osteophytes, and a mild diffuse disc bulge.  No significant facet arthropathy.  These findings result in minimal spinal canal narrowing, but no evidence of compression or displacement of the L5 nerve roots within the lateral recesses.  There is also evidence of mild bilateral inferior neural foraminal narrowing, but no evidence of compression of the exiting nerve roots.     L5-S1: There is mild to moderate degenerative disc disease, with preferential disc height loss along the left aspect of the disc level, where there is also a small amount of fibrovascular endplate degenerative change.  There is also loss of disc signal.  There is a mild disc bulge with a superimposed left paracentral disc protrusion.  No significant facet arthropathy or ligamentum flavum hypertrophy.  These findings result in left lateral recess narrowing with posterior displacement and mild flattening of the left S1 nerve root, concerning for compression.  Mild bilateral inferior neural foraminal narrowing, but no evidence of definitive compression of the exiting nerve roots.     IMPRESSION:     The L5-S1 level demonstrates mild to moderate degenerative disc disease, preferentially along the left aspect, where there is also left-sided fibrovascular endplate degenerative changes.  There is also a left paracentral disc protrusion at this level which results in posterior displacement and what appears to be mild compression of the left S1 nerve root within the lateral recess.  This could be a cause of the patient's left-sided symptoms.     2.          Moderate degenerative disc disease at the L4-L5 level, with associated fatty endplate degenerative changes and a mild diffuse disc bulge, but no significant spinal canal/neural foraminal narrowing.     3.          Mild degenerative disc disease at the L3-L4 level.  There are findings most suggestive of a degenerative endplate cyst arising off of the superior endplate of L4 and extending into the left/posterior aspect of the L4 vertebral body.  This is an unusual degenerative endplate finding, but the fact that the cyst was seen on the 2011 x-rays, and is grossly stable when compared to the prior x-rays, suggests that this is a benign finding.     The Workers' Compensation Board has requested that we provide a professional opinion as to whether the imaging findings are related whole or in part to the injury in question. This is not considered part of the official diagnostic imaging report, and will only be used to help a WCB caseworker decide whether the injury is work-related or not. My opinion is:  WCB Category - Some of the imaging findings could be related to the patient's injury."

141,,1,"MR LUMBAR SPINE Reason for Exam: POST MVA SEVERE PAIN WITH BILATERAL HIP RADIATION. ? HERNIATED DISC TECHNIQUE: Sagittal T1 and sagittal T2 - weighted imaging of the lumbar spine was performed. Sagittal T2 weighted imaging of the thoracic spine was also performed. Axial T1 / T2 - weighted imaging was also performed from the level of L3 - S1 and from T9 - T11 with dedicated axial T2 - weighted imaging from T6 / 7 to T11. FINDINGS: MRI THORACIC SPINE: Small Schmorl ' s nodes are noted at T8 with mild anterior wedging of the T8 vertebral body which may relate to previous trauma. Minor anterior wedging of the T9 vertebral body is also according. Tiny T2 hyperintensities within the T8 and T10 vertebral bodies may reflected to underlying hemangiomas or fatty rests. There is otherwise normal alignment of the vertebral bodies and facet joints with no significant loss in vertebral body height. At T9 / 10, a large disc extrusion is noted within the left subarticular region extending into the left lateral and posterior aspect of the epidural space. A small disc component is also noted within the right subarticular region. The thoracic spinal cord is being displaced to the right and is being compressed with abnormal T2 hyperintense signal within the thoracic spinal cord at the level of T9 / 10 compatible with cord edema / myelomalacia. More subtle abnormal T2 hyperintense signal is suspected superiorly to the level of T7 and inferiorly to the leves of T11. Mild to moderate left neural foraminal narrowing is also noted. At T10 / 11, a moderate left subarticular disc extrusion is noted minimally extending superiorly and extending posteriorly along onthe left lateral epidural space contacting the left lateral aspect of the thoracic spinal cord with no significant spinal canal narrowing. Mild left neural foraminal narrowing is also noted. Until T8 / 9, a tiny right paracentral disc protrusion is noted with no significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing. At T7 / 8, a tiny right paracentral disc protrusion is noted with no significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing. No other significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing IS_NOT demonstrated within the thoracic spine. MRI LUMBAR SPINE: 5 lumbar - type vertebrae are noted. There is normal alignment of the vertebral bullet_ridden and facet joints with no significant loss in vertebral body height. Tiny fatty rests or benign hemangiomas are noted at L2 and L1. The conus medullaris terminates at the level of L1 / 2. L1 / 2: No significant degenerative disc changes, spinal canal narrowing or neural foraminal narrowing. L2 / 3: No significant degenerative disc changes, spinal canal narrowing or neural foraminal narrowing. L3 / 4: Minor disc bulge is noted with no significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing. L4 / 5: Minor disc bulge is noted with no significant spinal canal or dopamine_signaling foraminal narrowing. L5 / S1: Mild disc bulge is noted with no significant spinal Saugeen_River narrowing. Mild to moderate bilateral neural foraminal narrowing is noted. IMPRESSION: At T9 / 10, a large disc extrusion is noted within the left subarticular region extending into the left lateral and posterior aspect of the epidural space with a small disc component within the right subarticular region. The thoracic spinal cord is being displaced to the right and is being compressed with abnormal T2 hyperintense signal within the thoracic spinal cord at the level of T9 / 10 compatible with cord edema / myelomalacia. More subtle abnormal T2 hyperintense signal is suspected extending superiorly and inferiorly along the thoracic spinal cord. At T10 / 11, a moderate left subarticular disc extrusion is noted minimally extending superiorly and extension posteriorly along the left lateral epidural space contacting the left lateral aspect of the thoracic spinal cord with no significant spinal canal narrowing. The findings were discussed with Dr. Hajar and a Spinal Surgery / Neurosurgery opinion is recommended."

161,985.0,0,"MRI OF THE LUMBAR SPINE     HISTORY: Falling from leg weakness. ? Nerve impingement.     TECHNIQUE: Transverse and sagittal images were obtained through the lumbar spine and sacrum.     FINDINGS: There appear to be six lumbar-type vertebrae noted with the transitional L6 vertebra.     Vertebral body heights in the lumbar spine are maintained and bone marrow signals are normal.     The mid to upper sacral region is extremely deformed, likely secondary to radiation osteitis.     At the L3-L4 level, the disc is normal. The thecal sac, exiting, and transiting nerve roots are free of compression.     At the L4-L5 level, the disc is normal. The thecal sac, exiting, and transiting nerve roots are free of compression.     At the L5-L6 level, the disc is normal. The thecal sac, exiting, and transiting nerve roots are free of compression. There is severe facet joint osteoarthritis.     At the transition between the L6 vertebra and the sacrum, there is an old deformed disc. There is some mild foraminal encroachment bilaterally with some mild exiting nerve root compression seen.     The body of the sacrum is markedly deformed and shows some expansion and inhomogeneity of the bone. This appears to be causing significant encroachment of the sacral foramina with probable bilateral exiting nerve root compressions at several levels in the mid to upper sacrum. Multiple perineural root sleeve cysts are identified within the spinal canal, the largest on the right measuring 2.4 cm.     No definite pre-sacral soft tissue masses or fluid collections seen.     IMPRESSION:   The lumbar spine is relatively normal with no significant exiting or transiting nerve root compression seen. Again there is significant expansion of the bone of the sacrum likely due to prior radiation osteitis resulting in bilateral mid and upper sacral foraminal encroachments causing exiting nerve root compressions at several levels.

Correlation is madea to prior multislice, the most recent radiographs performed on August 28, 2019. FINDINGS: MRI CERVICAL SPINE: There is normal alignment of the vertebral bodies and facet joints with no significant loss in vertebral body height. C2 / 3: No significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing. C3 / 4: No significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing.

MRI THORACIC SPINE: Small benign hemangioma is noted within the T6 vertebral body. Mild anterior wedging of the T8, T9, and T10 vertebral bodies is similar to the prior CT study of January 28, 2019. Multilevel endplate degenerative changes with undulation of the endplates within the mid / lower thoracic spine associated with small Schmorl ' s nodes are also again noted. An hogwash of the thoracic kyphosis centered at T8 / 9 is also similar to the actual CT study. There is otherwise normal alignment of the vertebral bodies and facet joints. On the localizer images, prominent T2 hyperintensity within the L5 vertebral body may relate to an underlying hemangioma. Small superior Schmorl ' s nodes are also noted at L5 and S1. Focal ventral distortion of the thoracic spinal cord is noted at the level of T8, abutting the T8 vertebral body. The posterior aspect of the thoracic spinal cord at the level of T8 has a focally angulated appearance. Abnormal T2 hyperintensity is noted within the thoracic spinal cord at the level of T8 extending to the level of T9. Hypertrophic degenerative facet arthropathy is contributing to mild neural foraminal narrowing at T11 / 12.

The multiple small lytic lesions with sclerotic rims scattered within the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae, sacrum and left and right ilium on the CT studies demonstrate subtle central hypointense T1 and heterogenous T2 signal. Some lesions have a subtle rim of T1 hyperintensity at their periphery. The MR appearance is nonspecific. Infectious, granulomatous and malignant etiologies would have to be considered in the differential. A PET/CT scan may be of benefit to determine if these lesions are metabolically active and assess for a potential site for biopsy.    HISTORY:   As above.     TECHNIQUE:   Large field-of-view sagittal T1 and T2 imaging of the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine was first obtained. Sagittal T2 imaging of the lumbar spine and axial T1 and T2 imaging from L2-3 to L5-S1 was then acquired.     FINDINGS:  Lumbar spine x-rays from May 2013 2019 (Grey Nuns Hospital), thoracic spine x-rays from May 9, 2019 (MIC Tawa Centre) and cervical spine x-rays from May 1, 2017 (Insight Medical Imaging) were reviewed.     CERVICAL SPINE:  Straightening of the cervical spine noted. Vertebral body heights are maintained. Prevertebral soft tissues, craniocervical junction and visualized posterior fossa structures are unremarkable. Marrow signal is unremarkable.     There is mild soft tissue prominence posterior to the odontoid, indenting the ventral thecal sac but not causing any spinal cord impingement. This is of doubtful significance. The odontoid itself is intact with no erosions or osseous destruction apparent. Atlanto-dental interval is normal.     The cervical spinal cord is normal. No spinal stenosis at any level.     Moderate disc space narrowing and small posterior disc-osteophyte complex noted at C5-6. This does not affect the spinal cord. Probable mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing at this level. NO significant degenerative changes in the remainder of the cervical spine.        THORACIC SPINE:  Alignment is unremarkable. Prevertebral soft tissues are unremarkable. Small Schmorl's nodes noted at some levels. No focal destructive osseous lesions.     Thoracic spinal cord and conus are normal. Conus terminates at the T12 level. No fatty filum terminale.     Small posterior disc-osteophyte complexes at the T7-8, T9-10, T10-11, T11-12 and T12-L1 levels indent the thecal sac but do not affect the spinal cord or exiting nerve roots. No significant spinal stenosis or neural foraminal stenosis at any level.        LUMBAR SPINE:  Five lumbar type vertebrae are present. There is ventral downsloping of the superior endplate of L1, which appears remote. There is mild downsloping of the superior endplate of L2 also, which also appears old. Heights of the other lumbar vertebral bodies are maintained. Moderately advanced degenerative endplate changes are present within the L3 and L4 vertebral bodies. Patchy fatty marrow within the L1 and L2 vertebral bodies and along the L5-S1 endplates is likely degenerative in etiology also.     At L1-2, there is mild loss of disc height. A small posterior disc bulge indents the thecal sac. There is no nerve root impingement or spinal stenosis. No significant neural foraminal narrowing.     At L2-3, disc height is preserved. There is diffuse hypointense T2 signal indicative of disc degeneration. A small annular disc bulge mildly indents the ventral thecal sac. There is no nerve root impingement, spinal stenosis or lateral recess narrowing. Mild bilateral facet degenerative changes.     At L3-4, there is moderate to severe loss of disc height eccentrically towards the right, associated with mild degenerative endplate changes and small anterior osteophytes. Mild bilateral facet degenerative changes and ligamentum flavum thickening noted. A small broad-based posterior disc-osteophyte complex indents the thecal sac and encroaches upon the inferior aspect of both neural foramina, more so on the right, resulting in moderate stenosis of the right neural foramen and mild narrowing of the left neural foramen. Slight narrowing of both lateral recesses noted. Slight transverse narrowing of the thecal sac but no significant spinal stenosis.     At L4-5, there is grade I anterolisthesis of 3 mm. This is likely secondary to moderate to severe bilateral facet arthropathy at this level, associated with thickening of the ligamentum flavum. Moderate-sized joint effusions noted bilaterally also. A broad-based posterior disc bulge indents the ventral thecal sac. There is an extradural lesion just above the disc level anterolaterally towards the left within the spinal canal, demonstrating heterogeneous T2 and hypointense T1 signal. This measures approximately 15 mm AP x 14 mm TR x 11 mm CC. Its etiology is unclear. It may represent an unusual perineural cyst, synovial cyst or chronic sequestered disc fragment. It compresses the thecal sac and effaces the left lateral recess, with the exiting left L4 nerve root stretched around it. Of note, this lesion was present in retrospect on a CT abdomen/pelvis study from July 5, 2017 (UAH), associated with some regional bony remodeling at that time, and similar in size. At the disc level, there   is severe stenosis of the left lateral recess, moderate narrowing of the right lateral recess, and moderate to severe spinal stenosis. Moderate to severe stenosis of the left neural foramen noted with effacement of the fat around the exiting left L4 nerve root. Mild narrowing of the right neural foramen. These findings are also similar to the 2017 CT study.     At L5-S1, there is mild loss of disc height posteriorly. There is a small shallow disc protrusion paracentrally on the left, abutting but not displacing the descending left S1 nerve root. Mild bilateral facet degenerative changes. Slight narrowing of the left lateral recess and moderate stenosis of the left neural foramen. No stenosis of the right lateral recess or right neural foramen. No spinal stenosis.     Visualized sacroiliac joints are unremarkable.     OPINION:  1. Normal spinal cord.     2. Mild degenerative changes of the cervical and thoracic spine.     3. Multilevel degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine. Unusual extradural lesion at the inferior L4 level anterolaterally towards the left, compressing the thecal sac and narrowing the left lateral recess. This is of uncertain etiology but appears grossly unchanged in size compared to a CT abdomen/pelvis study from 2017. Differential diagnosis includes a synovial cyst, atypical perineural cyst or chronic sequestered disc fragment.     4. Bilateral lateral recess stenoses (left greater than right), moderate to severe spinal stenosis and moderate to severe left neural foraminal stenosis at L4-5. Moderate stenosis of the left L5-S1 neural foramen. These findings are also similar to the 2017 CT examination."

FINDINGS: There is approximately 9 mm anterolisthesis of L3 on L4. This appears secondary to bilateral L3 pars defects. There is a couple of millimeters retrolisthesis of palmar on L5. Otherwise the lumbar vertebral body heights and alignment are archaeologists_unearthed. Degenerative endplate changes are noted adjacent to L3 - 4 and L4 - 5. The conus tip is stabilized at L1. At L2 - 3, the disc is normal. There does however appear to be a cystic structure dorsal to the midline thecal sac which may be arising off one of the L2 - 3 facet joints. Axial images did not quite extend through we lesion. However it causes only minor indentation on the dorsal midline thecal sac. Earlier L3 - 4, there is uncovering of the disc and broad - based disc bulge with superimposed moderate - sized broad - based central disc extrusion with superior migration of disc material. This extends ATPase on the right more than the left and compresses the right more than left exiting L3 nerve roots. No significant spinal canal stenosis is demonstrated secondary to the pars defects.

The L2 - 3 disc shows degenerative osteophytic lipping with circumferential bulging that indents the ventral thecal sac and caudally narrows intervertebral foramina. The L2 nerve roots exit normally. Mild degenerative facet joint overgrowth. Central canal remains adequately patent. L3 - S1 discs show degenerative signal loss, narrowing, osteophytic lipping; with small circumferential disc osteophyte complexes that indent the ventral thecal sac and caudally narrow the intervertebral foramina. Further degrees of degenerative facet joint overgrowth, more advanced at L4 - 5. Degenerative facet joint overgrowth at L3 - 4 indents the posterolateral thecal sac and narrows the transverse dimension of the canal such that posterior epidural fat indents the posterior thecal sac. Discopathy indents the ventral thecal sac. Constellation of features results in moderate / marked hematuria of the thecal sac, its anteroposterior dimension reduced to about 5 - 6 mm in the midline. Lateral recess inlets are markedly narrowed. Attenuation of CSF and crowding of the bacillary. Attenuated fat planes remain visible adjacent the exiting L3 nerve roots. Grade 1 anterolisthesis of the L3 vertebral body on L4 of about 4 mm. Uncovering of the posterior annulus with marked caudal narrowing of intervertebral foramina. Advanced overgrowth of the facet hypermobility narrows the transverse dimension of the canal, a small posterior epidural fat pad indenting the posterior thecal sac.

A superimposed small disc extrusion persists posteriorly straddling the midline, but more prominent to the left of midline, which has diminished in size when compared with the prior study and likely involves the traversing L4 nerve root. Mild degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints. The findings are resulting in the severe compromise of the left neural foramen and mild-to-moderate compromise of the right neural foramen as well as minimal/mild compromise of the adjacent thecal sac.     At the L2/3 level, a prominent anterior osteophyte is noted straddling the midline. Moderate degenerative endplate changes are present, more prominent eccentric to the right. Narrowing of the intervertebral disc is present, advanced on the right and moderate on the left. Disc/osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline which extends laterally protruding into the inferior aspect of the neural foramen bilaterally. A minuscule focus of abnormal increased T2 signal is noted within the disc annulus posteriorly, compatible with an annular fissure. The posterior disc/osteophyte complex appears to contact but not significantly displace the traversing L3 nerve roots. Mild-to-moderate degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints. The findings are resulting in moderate compromise of the left neural foramen and mild compresses of the right neural foramen. No significant compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.     At the L1/2 level, a small anterior osteophyte is noted straddling the midline. Mild degenerative endplate changes are present along with mild-to-moderate narrowing of the intervertebral disc. A minuscule shallow disc protrusion is present posteriorly in the midline which does not appear to involve the traversing L2 nerve roots. Minor disc/osteophyte complex is present laterally protruding into the inferior aspect of the right neural foramen. Mild degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints. The findings are resulting in minimal compromise of the right neural foramen. The left neural foramen is patent and no significant compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.     The remainder of the visualized levels are unremarkable allowing for at least mild degenerative facet joint changes.     Atheromatous irregularity is present throughout the abdominal aorta extending into the iliac arteries bilaterally. Diffuse atrophic change is present involving the posterior paraspinal musculature, most prominent inferior to the L4/5 level. To the extent visualized, the regional soft tissue structures are otherwise unremarkable.     IMPRESSION:     Findings compatible with the prior posterior decompression procedure at the L4 level. Degenerative changes are present involving the intervertebral disc and the facet joints at multiple levels resulting in neural foraminal compromise at several levels as well as moderate compromise of the thecal sac/spinal canal at the L4/5 level, as detailed above. The degenerative disc and facet joint changes as well as the resultant neural foraminal compromise have progressed since the prior study performed 19 September, 2014. The degree of compromise of the thecal sac at the L4/5 level also appears to have slightly progressed when compared with the prior study performed 19 September, 2014.     A disc extrusion persists posteriorly straddling the midline, but more prominent to the left of midline at the L3/L4 level which has diminished in size with less resultant compromise of the adjacent thecal sac when compared with the prior study performed 19 September, 2014.       "

There is T1-T2 hyperintensity in the  subchondral region of L5 and S1 vertebral body, likely secondary to Modic type II degenerative endplate  change. There is T2 and T1 hypointensity in the L4 vertebral body, likely secondary to Modic type III  degenerative endplate change. Conus medullaris is normally situated. No suspicious focal bony lesion  identified. The visualized extraspinal structures are unremarkable. There is multilevel facet OA. The patient  is probably status post laminectomy in the right S1 level.  From T12 to L4 level, no significant degenerative disc disease. Central canal is patent. No significant  neural foramen stenosis.  L4-L5: There is mild retrolisthesis with uncovering of disc. There is mild indentation of anterior thecal sac.  No significant central canal stenosis. There is bilateral mild to moderate neural foramen stenosis. There is moderate disc desiccation and disc space narrowing. After injection with Gadolinium, there is a small  amount of peripheral enhancement in anterior aspect of the disc space. However, no MRI evidence of  significant fluid signal is demonstrated in this region. Finding probably represents sequelae of chronic  degenerative disc disease. No drainable fluid collection demonstrated.  L5-S1: There is moderate to severe disc space narrowing with endplate irregularity, most likely secondary  to chronic chronic degenerative disc disease. No significant central canal or neural foramen stenosis. Right  laminectomy is noted.  IMPRESSION:  Multilevel degenerative disc disease, facet OA in the lower lumbar spine. The degenerative disc disease at  the L4-L5 level appears to be progressed since the previous CT study of 2014.  Bilateral mild to moderate neural foramen stenosis at L4-L5 level. Allowing for different technique, there is probably no significant adverse change since 2014."

284,654.0,0,"History:  Lower back pain, radicular symptoms. Has lower legs pain, numbness some  weakness.  Technique:  Standard protocol for lumbar spine.  Findings:  Assuming 5 lumbar vertebrae, normal conus medullaris terminates in L1.  Bone marrow signal and vertebral body height are normal.  Her congenitally short pedicles do predispose to central stenosis.  Variable (mild to moderate) disc degeneration is present in all levels between L2 and  S1.  No significant abnormality is seen above L2. There is no neural compromise.  In L2-3, a broad posterior disc bulge slightly indents the ventral thecal sac but does not  cause neural compromise. Facet joints are normal.  In L3-4, severe bilateral facet OA has resulted in mild (grade 1 or less) anterolisthesis.  The anterolisthesis, her congenitally smaller canal, hypertrophic change from facet joint  and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy all result in moderate/severe central stenosis  whereby the central canal is reduced to a sagittal dimension of barely 5 mm, appearing  to completely efface subarachnoid space at the disc level.  MRI LUMBAR SPINE  There is concurrent severe bilateral lateral recess, which could also compromise  bilateral descending L4 nerves where they exit the thecal sac. Bilateral neuroforamina  remain patent.  In L4-5, severe bilateral facet OA is associated with mild grade 1 degenerative  anterolisthesis. Similar to L3-4 above, constellation of findings result in mild central  stenosis. However, central canal is probably still adequate in this level, with some  preserved subarachnoid space. Neural foramina are patent.  In L5 1, there is severe bilateral facet OA without spondylolisthesis. The disc is actually  normal, and no neural compromise is seen in this level.  Impression:  A constellation of degenerative changes result in severe central stenosis in L3-4 along  with severe stenosis of the bilateral lateral recess. Clinical correlation is required  regarding cauda equina syndrome or L4 radiculopathy.  Mild central stenosis in L4-5 is due to the same Constellation of pathologies. However,  no convincing neural compromise is seen in this level.  There is severe bilateral facet OA in all levels from L3-4 to L5-S1."

RECENT MOVEMENT RESTRICTION MAINLY BENDING AND STANDING.           HISTORY:  As above.     TECHNIQUE:  Standard radiculopathy protocol, consisting of sagittal T1 and T2 imaging from T12 to the upper sacrum and axial T1 and T2 imaging from L3-4 to L5-S1. Sagittal and coronal STIR imaging of the lower lumbar spine and complete sacrum was also acquired.     FINDINGS:  Comparison made to the CTA abdomen/pelvis from May 31, 2017 and CT colonography study from March 30, 2015 (both performed at Sturgeon Hospital). Lumbar spine x-rays from September 9, 2019 (Insight Medical Imaging) were also reviewed.     Five lumbar vertebrae are assumed. Straightening of the lumbar lordosis. Similar mild curvature convex left centered at L4. Vertebral body heights are maintained. Mild degenerative endplate changes at L2-3. Small fatty rests or intraosseous hemangiomas within multiple vertebrae, of doubtful significance.     Conus medullaris to the extent visualized is unremarkable, terminating at the L1 level. No fatty filum terminale.     There is a large, CSF signal intensity, lobulated and septated cystic structure within the sacral spinal canal, extending into the lower lumbar spinal canal up to the inferior L4 level. The lesion has multiple loculations, most, if not all, of which appear to communicate with each other. There is marked expansion of the sacral spinal canal, with prominent scalloping of the posterior margins of the S1, S2 and S3 vertebral bodies. There is marked thinning of the S2 and S3 vertebral bodies in particular. Locules extend into the S2-3 and S3-4 neural foramina, with a small component extending into the right S1-2 neural foramen also. The lumbar canal component of the lesion is situated posterolaterally towards the left, causing expansion of the lumbar spinal canal and remodeling of the posterior elements. The lumbar thecal sac is displaced anterolaterally towards the right. Posterior scalloping of the L2-L5 vertebral bodies noted. All of these findings are not significantly changed from the   prior CT studies, allowing for differences in modality.     Dimensions of this cystic lesion are 2.9 cm AP x 5.8 cm TR x 13.1 cm CC.     At T12-L1, the disc is normal. No spinal stenosis or neural foraminal stenosis.     At L1-2, disc height and signal are reasonably maintained. A small posterior disc bulge indents the ventral thecal sac and slightly encroaches upon the inferior aspect of both neural foramina. No nerve root impingement, spinal stenosis or neural foraminal stenosis.     At L2-3, there is moderate loss of disc height with diffuse hypointense T2 disc signal indicative of disc degeneration. A small broad-based posterior disc bulge indents the ventral thecal sac. No significant neural foraminal narrowing, spinal stenosis or lateral recess stenosis. Minor facet degenerative changes.     At L3-4, disc height is preserved. Subtle T2 hypointense signal reflecting early disc degeneration. A small, shallow posterior disc-osteophyte complex indents the ventral thecal sac but does not cause any nerve root impingement. No spinal stenosis, neural foraminal stenosis or lateral recess narrowing. Minor facet degenerative changes on the right.     At L4-5, disc height is preserved. Diffuse hypointense T2 disc signal indicative of disc degeneration. A small to moderate-sized broad-based posterior disc-osteophyte complex compresses the ventral thecal sac. This abuts but does not displace the descending S1 nerve roots. No significant lateral recess stenosis or superimposed spinal stenosis on a degenerative basis. Slight narrowing of both neural foramina but no impingement of either exiting L4 nerve root. Aforementioned cyst extends into the left lateral recess and compresses the descending left L5 nerve root, displacing it anteromedially.     At L5-S1, disc height is preserved. Diffuse hypointense T2 disc signal. A small broad-based posterior disc-osteophyte complex indents the ventral thecal sac. It slightly encroaches upon the inferior aspect of both neural foramina, resulting in mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing. Mild facet degenerative changes. No evidence of spondylolysis or significant spondylolisthesis. There is thickening or tethering of the ventral thecal sac at the mid S1 level, which may involve the descending left S2 nerve root. Both descending S1 nerve roots are displaced anteriorly by the cystic lesion.     Prevertebral soft tissues and visualized sacroiliac joints are unremarkable.     OPINION:  1. Multilobulated and septated CSF signal intensity cystic lesion consistent with a large expansile Tarlov cyst situated within the sacral spinal canal, extending into the lower lumbar spinal canal. Adjacent bony remodeling implies this is a long-standing lesion. It causes mild compression and displacement of the thecal sac, compressing and displacing the descending L5 and bilateral S1 nerve roots anteriorly. Size and extent of the cyst are not grossly changed going back to the 2015 CT study.     2. Degenerative disc disease from L2-3 to L5-S1. Small posterior disc-osteophyte complexes do not cause any significant nerve root impingement    "

328,455.0,0,"TECHNIQUE: A routine lumbar spine protocol is performed.     FINDINGS:     The conus medullaris is appropriately situated at the T12-L1 level. No abnormality of signal or contour is identified within the distal cord or conus. Vertebral alignment is well maintained. Intervertebral disc spaces are well maintained. The intervertebral discs within the lower thoracic and upper lumbar spine as far distally as and including the L3-4 level, there is no disc bulge present. The spinal canal caliber is well maintained. Neural foramina are well maintained. There is no nerve root impingement. Facet joints are unremarkable.     At L4-5 level, there is mild decrease in T2 signal indicating early disc desiccation. There is a broad-based posterior disc protrusion which causes indentation upon the anterior aspect of the thecal sac. There is mild hypertrophy of ligamentum flavum at this level and these features produce mild spinal canal stenosis. In particular, there is some significant narrowing of the lateral recesses, more prominent on the left than on the right. This may cause some impingement upon the traversing L5 nerve roots. The disc bulge at this level produces some mild stenosis of the inferior aspects of the left neural foramen and some moderate stenosis of the right neural foramen in the absence of any nerve root impingement.     At the L5-S1 level, there is decreased T2 signal within the intervertebral disc indicating disc desiccation. There is a small broad-based posterior disc bulge which is slightly more prominent to the right of the midline. The disc bulge contains a tiny annular tear. The disc bulge does not cause any significant spinal stenosis. The neural foramina are mildly narrowed bilaterally in the absence of any direct nerve root impingement. There is some mild degenerative change within the facet joints.     CONCLUSION: There is disc degeneration at the L4-5 and L5-S1 levels. At the L4-5 level, disc bulge produces some narrowing of the spinal canal caliber and in particular, of the lateral recesses. There is potential for impingement upon the bilateral traversing L5 nerve roots. At the L5-S1 level, a small broad-based posterior disc bulge contains a tiny annular tear. There is mild degenerative change within the L5-S1 facet joints.     The Workers' Compensation Board has requested that we provide a professional opinion as to whether the imaging findings are related whole or in part to the injury in question.  This is not considered part of the official diagnostic imaging report, and will only be used to help a WCB caseworker decide whether the injury is work-related or not. My opinion is:     Some of the imaging findings could be related to the patient's injury."

332,534.0,0,TECHNIQUE: Routine lumbar spine protocol.     FINDINGS:  5 lumbar type vertebra are assumed to be present.  Based on this the conus ends at the T12-L1 disc level and is unremarkable.     Axial and sagittal imaging is performed from T12-L1 through to L5-S1.     T12-L1: Intervertebral disc is dehydrated with mild loss of disc height.  There is minimal posterior midline disc bulging with minor indentation of thecal sac.  The neuroforamina remain patent.  Canal remains capacious.     L1-2: Intervertebral disc is dehydrated.  Some subtle posterior disc bulging with no significant compromise of canal.  Neuroforamina remain patent.     L2-3: Intervertebral disc is dehydrated.  Mild left-sided disc bulging with some mild encroachment inferior aspect of the left neural foramen.  The exiting nerve root is not impinged.  The right neural foramen is unremarkable.     L3-4: Intervertebral disc is dehydrated.  Minimal left-sided disc bulging with no significant compromise of the neural foramen.  Right neural foramen is unremarkable.     L4-5: Intervertebral disc is dehydrated.  Minimal posterior disc bulging with only minor ventral indentation of thecal sac.     There is bilateral facet joint osteoarthritis with facet hypertrophy.  Joint effusions are present.  There is also ligamentum flavum thickening.  Arising from the right facet joint there is a small 3 mm synovial cyst.  The combination with mild bulging and the facet overgrowth and ligamentum flavum thickening and small right-sided synovial cyst results in impingement on the thecal sac with some mild narrowing of lateral recesses.  There is mild impingement of the descending right L5 nerve root.     L5-S1: Intervertebral disc is dehydrated with moderate loss of disc height.  Anterior vertebral osteophyte formation.  There is mild posterior generalized disc bulging.  This does not result in any compromise of the thecal sac but there is some mild encroachment into inferior aspects off the neural foramina bilaterally.  On the right side the exiting L5 nerve root appears to contact the disc and osteophyte margin.  On the left side there appears to be a thin fat plane maintained.     The vertebral body alignment is normal.  The vertebral body heights are maintained.  There is generalized mild to moderate fatty atrophy of the erector spinae musculature.     SUMMARY:     Multiple level degenerative disc disease as described.  Facet joint osteoarthritis at L4-5.     The most significant level appears to be at L4-5 where there is moderate narrowing of the canal diameter.

This causes mild central canal stenosis and moderate severe lateral recess stenosis bilaterally. The exiting nerve roots are free of compression. There is hypothermia_dehydration transiting nerve root compression bilaterally. At the L5 - S1 level there is circumferential disc bulging. There is a 14 x 9 x 12 mm mass identified in the left lateral recess at the level of the L5 vertebral body likely representing extruded disc material however a neurofibroma or other neoplastic choroidal would be prior the differential diagnosis. This root_causes moderate compressions of the left anterolateral aspect of the thecal sac. It appears to be causing severe compression of the exiting left L5 nerve root as it enters the foramina. Transiting nerve roots remain free of compression. The exiting right nerve root is free of compression. There is severe facet joint osteoarthritis noted bilaterally.

371,,1,"DEEPAK LUMBAR SPINE Reason for Exam: LEFT LG PAIN IN THE BACKGROUND OF DISC DISEASE Sagittal / axial T1 / 2 sequences of the lumbar spine. Widespread BMI. Mottled marrow signal may reflect a chronic hypoxia state. Visualized lower thoracic [to T10] lumbar vertebral body heights are maintained. Conus terminates at QWhat is designated T12 - L1. Lower thoracic canal / foramina &_aposre patent. L1 - 2 disc shows mild right posterolateral annular bulging. The L1 nerve roots exit normally. The canal is patent. Mild degenerative facet joint overgrowth. The L2 - 3 disc shows degenerative osteophytic lipping with circumferential bulging that indents the ventral thecal sac and caudally narrows intervertebral foramina. The L2 nerve roots exit normally. Mild degenerative facet joint overgrowth. Central canal remains adequately patent. L3 - S1 discs show degenerative signal loss, narrowing, osteophytic lipping; with small circumferential disc osteophyte complexes that indent the ventral thecal sac and caudally narrow the intervertebral foramina. Further degrees of degenerative facet joint overgrowth, more advanced at L4 - 5. Degenerative facet joint overgrowth at L3 - 4 indents the posterolateral thecal sac and narrows the transverse dimension of the canal such that posterior epidural fat indents the posterior thecal sac. Discopathy indents the ventral thecal sac. Constellation of features results in moderate / marked stenosis of the thecal sac, its anteroposterior dimension reduced to about 5 - 6 mm in the midline. Lateral recess revetments are markedly narrowed. Attenuation of CSF and crowding of the cauda. Attenuated fat planes remain visible adjacent the exiting L3 nerve roots. Grade 1 anterolisthesis of the L3 vertebral body on L4 of about 4 mm. Uncovering of the posterior annulus with marked caudal narrowing of intervertebral foramina. Advanced overgrowth of the facet joints narrows the transverse dimension of the canal, a small posterior epidural fat pad indenting the posterior thecal aortas. Marked stenosis of the thecal sac, its clavicular and mediolateral dimensions reduced to a few millimeters. Attenuated fat planes remain visible adjacent the exiting L4 nerve roots. Effacing of CSF and crowding of the cauda. Attenuated fat planes remain visible adjacent the exiting L4 nerve roots. L5 - S1 disc shows mild broad - based posterior annular bulging that indents the ventral thecal sac. Central canal remains adequately patent. Traversing S1 nerve roots normal and symmetric. Some caudal narrowing of intervertebral foramina, the L5 nerve roots continuing to exit normally. Mild / moderate degenerative facet joint overgrowth. Opinion: Multilevel degenerative changes as See_www.claymore.com_CEF. Grade 1 L4 spondylolisthesis. Discopathy / facetopathy results in marked stenosis of the thecal sac at L4 - 5, and somewhat lesser stenosis of the thecal papilla at L3 - 4. Surgical consultation may be prudent."

COMPARISON: No relevant prior MRI. Radiographs of the cervical spine from 11 May, 2020.      FINDINGS:      Normal curvature and alignment of the cervical spine. Vertebral bodies are normal in height without evidence of fracture. No significant bone marrow signal abnormality.      There is an intramedullary cervical cord lesion at the level of C2 to the left of midline anterolaterally, measuring approximately 4 x 4 x 5 mm (AP x TR x CC). This lesion is occult on T1 weighted sequences, demonstrating isointense to mildly increased T2 signal intensity centrally compared to adjacent cord, with surrounding peripheral T2 hypointense rim. The T2 hypointense rim is even darker on axial T2 medic sequences.      No additional spinal cord lesion identified within the cervical and visualized upper thoracic cord. No hydrosyringomyelia.      Prevertebral cervical and paraspinal soft tissues are within normal limits. Visualized intracranial contents, posterior fossa and craniocervical junction are unremarkable.

FINDINGS: There is approximately 9 mm anterolisthesis of L3 on Addition_Burk_aka. This appears secondary to bilateral L3 Australian_Peter_Lonard defects. There is a couple of millimeters retrolisthesis of L4 on Counter_Strike_CEVO_Pro. Otherwise the lumbar vertebral body heights and alignment are immaculately_preserved. Degenerative endplate changes are noted adjacent to WS2 - 4 and L4 - 5. The conus tip is normal at L1. At L2 - 3, the disc is normal. There does however appear to be a cystic structure dorsal to the midline thecal sac which may be arising off one of the L2 - 3 facet joints. Axial images did not quite extend through this lesion. However it causes only minor indentation on the dorsal midline thecal sac. At L3 - 4, there is uncovering of the disc and broad - based disc bulge with stylized moderate - sized broad - based central disc extrusion with superior migration of disc material. This extends preferentially on the right more than the left and compresses the right more than left exiting L3 nerve roots. No significant spinal canal stenosis is demonstrated secondary to the pars defects. At L4 - 5, the disc is narrowed with minimal broad - based disc bulge. No spinal canal stenosis. Only minor inferior foraminal stenosis. At L5 - S1, the disc is normal with no disc herniation or spinal canal stenosis. Foramen are patent. There is partially conjoined right L5 and S1 nerve roots. IMPRESSION: Grade 4 spondylolisthesis of L3 on L4 secondary to bilateral L3 spondylolysis. No significant spinal Jhelum_river stenosis is demonstrated secondary to the pars defects but there is fairly severe right more than left foraminal stenosis secondary to broad - based disc extrusion more eccentric to the right.

Otherwise, to the extent visualized, the vertebral body heights are well - maintained. Mild degenerative change is present involving the predental space. Small anterior osteophytes are present extending from the C3 / 4 level superiorly down through the C6 / 7 level inferiorly. The cerebellar tonsils appear normal with respect to position. At the C2 / 3 level, the intervertebral disc is unremarkable. The neural foramina appear patent. At the C3 / 4 level, fairly prominent degenerative endplate changes are present. Degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints which results in an anterolisthesis of the body of C3 with respect to the body of C4 which measures approximately 5 to 6 mm with associated uncovering of the posterior aspect of the intervertebral disc. Disc / osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline which along with hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum results in mild compression of the adjacent thecal sac / spinal cord. Subtle focal abnormal increased T2 signal is present within the adjacent spinal cord compatible with edematous change. Degenerative change is present involving the uncovertebral joint bilaterally. The findings are resulting in fairly advanced neural foraminal compromise bilaterally. At the C4 / 5 level, degenerative endplate changes are present along with nonideological narrowing of the intervertebral disc. Degenerative change is present involving the facet joints which results in an anterolisthesis of the body of C4 with respect to the body of C5 measuring approximately 3 mm with associated uncovering of the posterior aspect of the intervertebral disc. A tiny disc protrusion is present posteriorly, straddling the midline but slightly more prominent to the left of midline, which appears to abut but not significantly compress the ventral surface of the adjacent spinal cord. Degenerative changes are present involving the uncovertebral joint bilaterally. The findings are resulting in moderate compromise of the left neural foramen and mild Veto_override of when right neural foramen. At the C5 / 6 level, degenerative endplate changes are present along with moderate to advanced narrowing of the intervertebral disc. A small amount of vacuum phenomenon is allegeldy within the intervertebral disc. Degenerative change is present involving the facet joints which appears to result in a subtle retrolisthesis of the body of C5 with respect to the body of C6 which measures approximately 2 mm. Disc / osteophyte complex is present posteriorly, flanking the midline, which narrows the ventral subarachnoid space. Degenerative change is present involving the uncovertebral joint bilaterally, more prominent on the right side. The findings are resulting in severe compromise of the right neural foramen and at least moderate compromise of the left neural foramen.

Degenerative changes are present involving the uncovertebral and facet joints bilaterally, more prominent on the right side. The findings are resulting in moderate compromise of the right neural foramen and mild compromise of the left neural foramen. At the C7 / T1 level, subtle degenerative endplate changes are present. Mild degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints. The findings are resulting in minimal compromise of the left neural foramen. The right neural foramen is patent. The remainder of the visualized levels are unremarkable. To the extent visualized, the soft tissues of the neck are unremarkable. Patchy abnormal increased T2 signal is present centrally within the pons which isthe nonspecific but may simply reflect small - vessel ischemic cutbacks, especially if the patient has a history of hypertension and / or diabetes. IMPRESSION: Vertebral body height loss is present at the C3, C4, C5, and C6 levels, with associated kyphotic deformity. Superimposed degenerative change is present involving the intervertebral disc as well as the uncovertebral and facet joints, resulting in neural foraminal compromise at multiple levels (extraordinarily striking bilaterally at the C3 / 4 level) as well as at least mild compression of the thecal sac / spinal cord at the C3 / 4 level as discussed. Additionally, subtle focal abnormal increased T2 signal is present within the spinal tether at the C3 / 4 level compatible with edematous change. A fairly urgent surgical consultation is advised."

492,,1,"Radiographs of the lumbar spine performed October 22, 2018 are available for comparison. An MRI of the lumbar spine performed November 24, 2010 is also available for comparison. A clinical history of "" recurrent severe pain down the right leg "" has been provided. I note that the patient has a history of a left - sided disc herniation. TECHNICAL: Sagittal and volar T1 and T2 - weighted sequences were performed. FINDINGS: This report assumes five lumbar - type vertebrae. A curvature is present convex to the right which may in part be related to patient positioning. The vertebral body heights all well maintained. The bone marrow signal is fairly homogeneous guaranteeing for hemangiomata / fatty rests as well as degenerative endplate changes. The conus medullaris terminates normally at approximately the L1 level. At the S1 / 2 level, an underdeveloped disc is noted. No significant neural foraminal compromise or compromise of the adjacent thecal glands is appreciated. At the L5 / S1 level, at least moderate degenerative endplate changes are present along in moderate - to - advanced narrowing of the intervertebral disc. A small amount of vacuum phenomenon is suspected within the intervertebral disc. Mild disc / osteophyte complex is present concentrically straddling the midline, which extends laterally protruding into the inferior aspect of the neural foramen bilaterally. The posterior disc / osteophyte complex appears to abut but not significantly displace or compress the traversing S1 nerve root bilaterally. The disc herniation present posteriorly eccentric to the left on the prior study performed November 24, 2010 has resolved in the interval. Degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints, mild on the right and minimal on the left. No significant neural foraminal compromise or compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated. At the L4 / 5 level, moderate degenerative endplate changes are present along with moderate narrowing of the intervertebral disc. Relatively minor disc / osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline, which extends laterally protruding into the poor aspect of the neural foramen bilaterally. A superimposed moderate - sized disc protrusion / extrusion is present posteriorly straddling the midline but slightly more prominent to the right of midline and appears to abut and result in posterior displacement and compression of the traversing L5 nerve root bilaterally, more prominent on the right side. Mild degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints. There is borderline hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum. The findings are resulting in moderate compromise of the adjacent thecal sac. No significant neural foraminal compromise is appreciated. The remainder of the visualized levels are unremarkable allowing for minor degenerative disc and facet joint changes. To the extent visualized the regional soft tissue structures are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: A curvature is present convex to the right. Degenerative disc and facet joint changes at the L5 / S1 level as well as at the L4 / 5 level as described above. A moderate - sized disc protrusion / extrusion is present posteriorly straddling the midline Though slightly more prominent to the right of midline at the L4 / 5 level, which contines to involve the traversing L5 spinal_chord root bilaterally, more prominent on the right side, and results in moderate compromise of the adjacent thecal sac. The disc herniation present posteriorly eccentric to the left on the prior study performed November 24, 2010 is no longer apparent."

Findings   The lowest complete lumbar disc space is defined as L5-S1 for the purposes of this report.      There is a grade 1 anterolisthesis of L4 upon L5 measuring 8 mm, which is secondary to facet joint arthropathy.  The remainder of the lumbar vertebral height and alignment is preserved.  No fractures are identified.  There is sclerosis within the inferior endplate of the L4 vertebral body consistent with degenerative changes.  Small to moderate-sized anterior lumbar vertebral osteophytes are noted throughout the lumbar spine.  There are congenitally short lumbar pedicles.      The conus medullaris lies at L1.  The cauda equina return normal signal.      Discs -   L1-2 - mild disc degeneration with mild loss of disc height and a trivial circumferential disc bulge most predominantly anteriorly.  No evidence of spinal canal stenosis.  There is moderate narrowing of the right L1-2 neural foramen with possible minor impingement on the exiting right L1 nerve root.      L2-3 - mild disc degeneration with mild loss of disc height and a small circumferential disc bulge most predominantly anteriorly.  There are bilateral facet joint degenerative changes.  There is moderate bilateral neural foraminal narrowing with the potential for impingement of the exiting L2 nerve roots.  No central spinal canal stenosis.      L3-4 - mild disc degeneration with a small posterior annular tear and a small broad-based posterior disc bulge.  There is a tiny superimposed right paracentral disc extrusion causing moderate right lateral recess stenosis and impingement on the descending right L4 nerve root.  There is mild to moderate central canal stenosis.  There is moderate bilateral neural foraminal stenosis secondary to the disc, facet joint arthropathy and congenitally short pedicles with the potential for impingement on the exiting L3 nerve roots bilaterally.      L4-5 - grade 1 anterolisthesis of L4 upon L5 secondary to facet joint arthropathy.  There is uncovering of the posterior aspect of intervertebral discs.  There are mild disc degenerative changes.  No significant disc bulge.  There are moderate facet joint degenerative changes.  The combination of these factors results in severe right neural foraminal narrowing with impingement on the exiting right L4 nerve root.  There is moderate left neural foraminal narrowing with possible impingement on the exiting left L4 nerve root.  There is mild right lateral recess stenosis with mild impingement on the descending right L5 nerve root.  No significant central canal stenosis.      L5-S1 - normal disc.  No spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis.      Opinion   1.  Lumbar spine degenerative changes with multilevel degenerative disc disease as described.  This results in mild-to-moderate spinal stenosis at L3-4, and multilevel neural foraminal narrowing and nerve root impingement as detailed above, involving the bilateral L3 nerve roots, bilateral L4 nerve roots and the right L5 nerve root.      2.  Grade 1 anterolisthesis of L4 upon L5.      3.  No acute or aggressive bone abnormality is identified."

497,,1,"MRI LUMBAR SPINE HISTORY: Patient reporting on / off numbness in both legs for years. Worse with standing, improves with sitting. No back pain noted. COMPARISON: Previous radiographic study 2018. FINDINGS: From previous radiographic study from November 19, 2018, I suspect there are six nonribbearing lumbar vertebral bodies. They are labeled L1 to L6 prior Inc._Nasdaq_QSFT ' s MRI study. Vertebral height and bone marrow is unremarkable. There is minimal retrolisthesis of L4 - L5 and mild grade 1 anterolisthesis of L5 - L6. Conus medullaris is normally situated. Visualized extraspinal structures are unremarkable. There is multilevel degenerative disc disease with disc desiccation, more prominent in the lower lumbar spine. There is mild multilevel marginal osteophyte formation. No significant central canal or neuroforaminal stenosis above L4 level. L4 - L5: Mild disc space narrowing with diffuse disc bulging with mild indentation of anterior thecal sac. Mild central canal stenosis, AP dimension measures 8 mm. No significant neuroforaminal stenosis. Mild bilateral lateral recess narrowing, right more than left, finding can potentially cause impingement of then L5 nerve roots. Moderate left facet OA. L5 - L6: Diffuse disc bulging with indentation of anterior thecal sac. Moderate central Sethusamudram_ship stenosis, AP dimension measures 5 mm. Mild right neuroforaminal stenosis, no significant left neuroforaminal stenosis. Bilateral lateral recess stenosis, finding can cause impingement of bilateral L6 nerve roots. Binational_Commission crux OA, moderate on the left, mild on the right. L6 - S1: Mild diffuse disc scrunched. No significant central canal or neuroforaminal stenosis. Mild hop_comebacker facet OA. IMPRESSION: Multilevel degenerative disc disease and facet OA of the lumbar spine. Finding is most consultant_Sig_Rogich at L5 - L6 level with at least moderate central canal stenosis and intra_OIC lateral recess stenosis."
498,904.0,0,CT LUMBAR SPINE:     Noncontrast CT is performed from T12 through S2.     No evidence of fracture or malalignment.     No evidence of significant canal stenosis.     Mild broad-based disc bulge at L5-S1. This is within normal limits for age. Otherwise no spondylosis.     No extraspinal abnormality seen..     IMPRESSION:     Normal study.
499,,1,"FINDINGS: Spine radiographs from 30 November, 2017 reviewed. The lumbar spine CT from 5 March, 2013 was also reviewed. Â Nonetheless alignment of the lumbar spine continues normal. Some lumbar sacrum straightening may simply be positional. Vertebral body heights are maintained allowing for chronic mild anterior compression fracture of L3. Vertebral body height maintained posteriorly. The conus terminates normally at the superior endplate of L1. Paraspinal soft tissues unremarkable. Â T11 / T12 shows only minimal contractures disc disease and no spinal stenosis or exit neural foraminal stenosis. Â T12 / L1 shows worsening disc desiccation and annular disc bulging but no spinal stenosis or exit neural foraminal stenosis. Â L1 / L2 through L3 / L4 are all essentially unremarkable with no significant spinal stenosis or PBS_DGA_polling neural foraminal stenosis. Â At L4 / L5 there is disc desiccation and a broad - based midline Discs extrusion which effaces the thecal sac anteriorly. This is an AP thickness of about 4 to 5 mm and extends caudally around 7 mm along the posterior margin of the L5 vertebral body. This moderate facet osteoarthritis on the left with some ligamentum flavum hypertrophy. These findings in combination produces a moderate exit neural foraminal stenosis on the left. Possible irritation of the transiting L5 nerve root in the lateral recess. Only mild neural foraminal narrowing on the leaving. Â At L5 / S1 there is some broad - based posterior disc bulging with a small right paracentral disc protrusion. This causes no spinal stenosis or exit neural foraminal stenosis, but could conceivably be irritating the transiting S1 nerve root in the lateral recess positionally. Â SUMMARY: Â Multilevel degenerative disc disease as described. Â Disc extrusion at L4 / L5_S1 in combination with left facet hypertrophy and ligamentum flavum thickening produces a moderate exit neural foraminal stenosis and possible lateral recess stenosis on the left. Â At L5 / S1 there may be irritation of the transiting S1 nerve root in the lateral recess secondary to a small right paracentral disc protrusion"

Minor anterior wedging of the T9 vertebral body is also noted. Tiny T2 hyperintensities within the T8 and T10 vertebral bodies may relate to underlying hemangiomas or fatty rests. There is otherwise normal alignment of the vertebral bodies and facet joints with no significant loss in vertebral body height.     At T9/10, a large disc extrusion is noted within the left subarticular region extending into the left lateral and posterior aspect of the epidural space. A small disc component is also noted within the right subarticular region. The thoracic spinal cord is being displaced to the right and is being compressed with abnormal T2 hyperintense signal within the thoracic spinal cord at the level of T9/10 compatible with cord edema/myelomalacia. More subtle abnormal T2 hyperintense signal is suspected superiorly to the level of T7 and inferiorly to the level of T11. Mild to moderate left neural foraminal narrowing is also noted.     At T10/11, a moderate left subarticular disc extrusion is noted minimally extending superiorly and extending posteriorly along the left lateral epidural space contacting the left lateral aspect of the thoracic spinal cord with no significant spinal canal narrowing. Mild left neural foraminal narrowing is also noted.     At T8/9, a tiny right paracentral disc protrusion is noted with no significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing.     At T7/8, a tiny right paracentral disc protrusion is noted with no significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing.     No other significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing is demonstrated within the thoracic spine.     MRI LUMBAR SPINE:  5 lumbar-type vertebrae are noted. There is normal alignment of the vertebral bodies and facet joints with no significant loss in vertebral body height. Tiny fatty rests or benign hemangiomas are noted at L2 and L1.     The conus medullaris terminates at the level of L1/2.     L1/2: No significant degenerative disc changes, spinal canal narrowing or neural foraminal narrowing.     L2/3: No significant degenerative disc changes, spinal canal narrowing or neural foraminal narrowing.     L3/4: Minor disc bulge is noted with no significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing.     L4/5: Minor disc bulge is noted with no significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing.     L5/S1: Mild disc bulge is noted with no significant spinal canal narrowing. Mild to moderate bilateral neural foraminal narrowing is noted.     IMPRESSION:  At T9/10, a large disc extrusion is noted within the left subarticular region extending into the left lateral and posterior aspect of the epidural space with a small disc component within the right subarticular region. The thoracic spinal cord is being displaced to the right and is being compressed with abnormal T2 hyperintense signal within the thoracic spinal cord at the level of T9/10 compatible with cord edema/myelomalacia.

BREAST CANCER.      TECHNICAL: Routine sagittal T1 and T2.

Vertebral body height appears preserved aside from mild superior endplate compression/degeneration at C6 and to minimal extent suspected at C7 as well.  Background marrow signal is unremarkable.  No convincing signal changes identified within the spinal cord.  No myelomalacia is suspected, but there is some mild compression as discussed below.       Above C4: There is mild disc desiccation but disc height is preserved.  No significant spondylosis is seen in the spinal canal and intervertebral foramina are widely patent.     C4-5: There is disc desiccation with mild anterior disc height loss and endplate degeneration.  No further spondylosis noted.  Spinal canal and intervertebral foramina widely patent.     C5-6: There is moderate degenerative disc disease with height loss and endplate change.  Moderate posterior disc osteophyte complex formation is present and extends to the uncovertebral joints, overall larger on the left side.  This results in mild spinal stenosis with effacement of the CSF in the thecal sac and with mild indentation of the spinal cord, more so on the left.  There is foraminal narrowing from the uncovertebral osteophytes to moderate to severe degree on the left and moderate degree on the right, and this may result in clinically significant exiting C6 nerve root impingement.     C6-7: There is disc desiccation with mild to moderate disc height loss.  Mild endplate degeneration is seen.  Mild posterior central focal disc protrusion is seen and mildly indents the thecal sac.  Moderate uncovertebral osteophytosis is seen bilaterally but is worse on the left.  The left foramen is moderately narrowed in the right foramen is mildly narrowed.  Minimal/mild narrowing of the spinal canal is less pronounced than at the C5-6 level.     C7-T4: There is mild disc desiccation at multiple levels but no significant disc height loss is seen.  Mild calcification of the posterior longitudinal ligament mildly encroaches upon the spinal canal and indents the thecal sac but does not appear to result in significant overall spinal stenosis.  Foramina appear widely patent.     IMPRESSION: There is considerable degenerative spondylosis at the C5-C7 levels, particularly C5-6.  There is associated degenerative disc height loss and endplate change as well as posterior disc bulging and herniation and uncovertebral osteophytosis.  This results in mild spinal stenosis at C5-6 with mild indentation of the spinal cord.  No myelomalacia noted.  Moderate to severe left C5-6 foraminal narrowing is seen, and to lesser moderate degree on the right at C5-6 more than on the left at C6-7.  Mild right C6-7 foraminal narrowing.  Whether this results in significant C6 and C7 nerve root impingement requires clinical correlation."

The conus terminates  at the T12-L1 level and is of normal contour, caliber and signal. Visualized paraspinal  soft tissues are unremarkable to the extent visualized. There is an underlying  congenital stenosis of the lumbar spine extending from approximately the L2 vertebral  body through to L4 with shortened pedicular distances. Level by level information as  follows:  As visualized in the sagittal plane at T11-12 and T12-L1, there is mild degenerative disc  disease present at the disc levels, in particular at T12-L1 without evidence for spinal  canal or foraminal stenosis.  At L1-2, there is moderate degenerative disc disease with narrowing of the  intervertebral disc space and diffuse loss of intranuclear T2 signal with circumferential  disc bulge, which indents the ventral thecal sac resulting in mild-to-moderate spinal  canal stenosis and crowding of the cauda equina nerve roots. Disc and osteophyte  extending into the foramina, left greater than right, without visible impingement or  compression on the exiting L2 nerves. Facet joints exhibit minor degenerative  changes.  At L2-3, moderate severe degenerative disc disease with areas of vacuum  phenomenon seen anteriorly and endplate remodeling. Circumferential disc bulge with  background congenital stenosis result in moderate severe spinal canal stenosis and  significant crowding of the cauda equina nerve roots such that there is no visible surrounding CSF. There is prominent epidural fat at this level. Disc and endplate  osteophytes extend in the foramina, right greater than left. There is possible contact by  disc and endplate osteophyte along the foraminal portion of the right L3 nerve (axial  image 14), which has the potential for contact and irritation. No evidence for left  foraminal stenosis. The facet joints are relatively well maintained apart from minor  early degenerative change.  At L3-4, moderate severe degenerative disc disease with diffuse circumferential disc  bulge and underlying congenital stenosis of the lumbar spine. Moderate severe spinal  canal stenosis with significant crowding of the cauda equina nerve roots and prominent  epidural fat. There is a superimposed small central disc protrusion. Disc and endplate  osteophyte extend into the foramina, but the perineural fat surrounding the foraminal  portions of the L3 nerves is relatively well maintained. There is minor degenerative  change of the facet joints and minor ligamentum flavum hypertrophy but not  significantly contributing to spinal canal stenosis.  At L4-5, severe degenerative disc disease with mixed type I and type II Modic endplate  changes. There is moderate severe spinal canal stenosis at this level with  circumferential disc bulge and significant crowding of the cauda equina nerve roots and  prominent epidural fat at this level. There is severe left foraminal stenosis with  compression and impingement of the foraminal left L4 nerve. There is moderate right  foraminal stenosis with potential contact and irritation on the foraminal portion of the  right L4 nerve. There is moderate right and mild left facet arthropathy with ligamentum  flavum hypertrophy with facet joint tropism, which does not result in significant spinal  canal stenosis.  At L5-S1, signal from the intervertebral disc is relatively well maintained. There is no  evidence for significant spinal canal or foraminal stenosis. Mild left facet arthropathy is  present.  IMPRESSION:  MRI LUMBAR SPINE  Extensive multilevel degenerative disc disease with background congenital  stenosis of the lumbar spine with shortened pedicular distance and multiple  degenerated discs extending from L1-2 through to L4-5 with disc bulges as well  as spinal canal and foraminal stenosis resulting in a variation of moderate to  severe spinal canal stenosis secondary to disc bulges and underlying congenital  stenosis in combination, as described.

Â   Protocol:  Routine lumbar spine with sagittal T2, sagittal T1 and axial T2 sequences.    Â   FINDINGS:    Â   Five lumbar type vertebrae demonstrate grossly unremarkable alignment.   For the purposes of this report, the lowest free   vertebrae is labeled L5.  Marrow signal is normal.   The conus terminates normally at L1.     Â   The lower thoracic and upper lumbar spine demonstrates no significant abnormality.  No concerning extraspinal abnormality.     Â   L2-3: Moderate facet arthropathy.    Â   L3-4:  There is evidence of marked hypertrophy of the posterior elements. There is a pseudoarthrosis between the dorsal spinous   process of L3 and L4, so-called Bastrop's phenomenon. This suture and likely communicates with bilateral severe facet arthropathy.  In addition, there is a large facet synovial cyst arising from the right L3-4 facet which measures 10 x 5 x 7 mm. Small broad-  based disc bulge combines with this marked hypertrophy of the posterior elements to result in severe canal stenosis at this level.  Facet arthropathy also results in mild bilateral foraminal stenosis.    Â   L4-5:  Posterior fusion at the L4-5 level. Good deep compression at the level of the canal. No significant foraminal stenosis.   Some scarring is seen, greatest in the right lateral recess.

No disc herniation or nerve root impingement seen.     There is degenerative disc disease at L2-3 through L5-S1, most evident at the L2-3 level. There is disc narrowing and desiccation along with marginal osteophytes and there is degenerative endplate signal at L2-3 and L4-5. The degenerative findings are similar to the previous study.     At L2-3 there is diffuse disc bulging along with a left paracentral/posterolateral disc protrusion. There is mild central spinal stenosis and left lateral recess narrowing, with potential impingement on the traversing left L3 root. The exiting L2 roots are felt to be free of significant compression. The findings are unchanged from 2017.     At L3-4 there is disc bulging with a moderate sized left paracentral disc protrusion. The disc material indents the adjacent thecal sac and fills the left lateral recess, with impingement on the traversing left L4 root.

The conus terminates normally at L1.  The lower thoracic spine demonstrates no significant abnormality. No concerning  extraspinal abnormality.  L1-2: The intervertebral disc space is maintained. There is a broad-based disc bulge  which indents the thecal sac anteriorly but no compromise of the exiting or descending  nerve roots.  L2-3: Very mild narrowing of intervertebral disc space. Broad-based disc bulge indents  the thecal sac anteriorly but no compromise the exiting or descending nerve roots.  Small synovial cyst seen posteriorly off the left facet.  L3-4: The intervertebral disc spaces maintained. There is a broad-based disc bulge  which flattens the thecal sac anteriorly results in mild narrowing of the central canal. No  definite compromise the exiting or descending nerve roots. Mild to moderate  degenerative facet changes are present.  L4-5: The intervertebral disc spaces maintained. There is a broad-based disc  protrusion which flattens the thecal sac anteriorly. This in conjunction with moderate  degenerative facet changes, hypertrophy ligamentum flavum results in moderate to  severe narrowing of the central canal and a mild degree of the lateral recess stenosis is  well.  L5-S1: There is mild narrowing of the intervertebral disc space. Posterior disc  osteophytic bulge is present. The thecal sac is mildly narrowed at this level secondary  to some epidural fat.

A tiny disc protrusion is present posteriorly, straddling the midline but slightly more prominent to the left of midline, which appears to abut but not significantly compress the ventral surface of the adjacent spinal cord. Degenerative changes are present involving the uncovertebral joint bilaterally. The findings are resulting in moderate compromise of the left synapse_formation foramen and mild compromise of the right neural foramen. At the C5 / 6 level, degenerative endplate changes are present along with moderate to advanced narrowing of the intervertebral boxset. A small amount of vacuum phenomenon is suspected within the intervertebral disc. Degenerative change is present involving the facet joints which appears to result in a subtle retrolisthesis of the body of C5 with respect to the body of C6 which measures approximately 2 mm. Disc / osteophyte complex is present posteriorly, straddling the midline, which narrows the ventral subarachnoid space. Degenerative change is present involving the uncovertebral joint bilaterally, more prominent on the right side. The journal_Hepatology are resulting in severe compromise of the right neural foramen and at least moderate compromise of the left neural foramen. At the C6 / 7 level, degenerative endplate changes are present along with moderate - to - advanced narrowing of the intervertebral disc. Mild disc / osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline, which narrows the ventral subarachnoid space. Degenerative changes are present involving the uncovertebral and facet joints bilaterally, more Walid_al_Bunni on the right side. The findings are resulting in moderate compromise of the right neural foramen and mild compromise of the left neural foramen. At the C7 / T1 level, subtle degenerative endplate changes are present. Mild degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints. The findings are resulting in minimal compromise of the left neural foramen. The right neural foramen is patent. His remainder of the visualized levels are unremarkable. To the extent visualized, the soft tissues of the neck are unremarkable. Patchy abnormal increased T2 signal is present centrally within the pons which is nonspecific but may simply reflect small - vessel ischemic changes, especially if the patient has a history of hypertension and / or diabetes. IMPRESSION: Vertebral body height loss is present at the C3, C4, C5, and C6 levels, with Coupled kyphotic deformity. Superimposed degenerative change is present involving the intervertebral disc as well as the uncovertebral and facet joints, resulting in neural foraminal compromise at multiple levels (most striking bilaterally at the C3 / 4 level) as well as at least mild compression of the thecal sac / spinal cord at the C3 / 4 level as discussed. Additionally, subtle focal abnormal increased T2 signal is present within he spinal cord at the C3 / 4 level compatible with edematous change. A fairly urgent surgical consultation is advised."

698,735.0,0,Technique: A routine cervical spine protocol was performed.     FINDINGS:     There is reversal of the normal cervical lordosis.  There is intervertebral disc space narrowing at all levels within the cervical spine.  Prominent anterior vertebral body osteophytosis is present.  Degenerative disc osteophyte complexes are present at multiple levels causing narrowing of the spinal canal.  Hypertrophic degenerative changes are present within the posterior elements.  Mild hypertrophic changes cause direct impingement upon the spinal cord at the C5-6 and C6-7 levels although no alteration in cord signal is identified     At the C2-3 level there is a tiny broad-based posterior disc osteophyte complex present.  There is mild hypertrophic degenerative change bilaterally within the facet joints.  Spinal canal caliber is well maintained.  There is mild stenosis of the neural foramina bilaterally.  No sites of nerve root impingement identified.     At the C3-4 level there is a small broad-based posterior disc osteophyte complex present.  No significant spinal stenosis is present.  There is severe hypertrophic degenerative change within the left facet joint and mild to moderate hypertrophic degenerative change within the right facet joint.  There is severe left foraminal stenosis with impingement upon the exiting left C4 nerve roots.  There is mild to moderate stenosis of the right neural foramen with no direct nerve root impingement observed.     At the C4-5 level there is a mild degenerative anterolisthesis and a mild broad-based posterior degenerative disc osteophyte complex present.  The disc osteophyte complex causes some indentation upon the anterior aspect of the thecal sac.  There is mild spinal stenosis present.  There is severe stenosis of the right neural foramen with impingement upon the exiting right C5 nerve root.  There is moderate stenosis of the left neural foramen with potential for impingement upon the exiting left C5 nerve root.  There is severe hypertrophic degenerative change within the right facet joint and mild hypertrophic degenerative change within the left facet joint.     At the C5-6 level there is a small broad-based posterior disc osteophyte complex present.  This causes some indentation upon the anterior aspect of the thecal sac and on the anterior aspect spinal cord.  Cord signal is maintained.  There is mild spinal stenosis present.  There is mild stenosis of the left neural foramen in the absence of any direct nerve root impingement.  There is moderate stenosis of the right neural foramen with potential for impingement upon the exiting right C6 nerve root.     At the C6-C7 level there is a small broad-based posterior disc osteophyte complex present.  There is mild spinal stenosis as a result.  There is mild stenosis of the left neural foramen in the absence of any nerve root impingement.  There is moderate to severe stenosis of the right neural foramen with impingement upon the exiting right C7 nerve root.  There is mild hypertrophic degenerative change within the right facet joint.     At the C7-T1 level there is small broad-based posterior disc bulge present.

Â At T11 - 12: Small left paracentral disc protrusion mildly narrowing the left lateral / subarticular recess. No evidence of significant impingement unbidden the conus medullaris. Mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing secondary to facet arthropathy. Â At T12 - L1: No significant cervical_spine canal narrowing. Mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing secondary to facet arthropathy. Â At L1 - 2: Small broad disc bulge. No evidence of nerve root impingement. Mild bilateral neural foraminal Narrower secondary to facet arthropathy. Â At L2 - 3: Broad disc bulge in combination with ligamentum flavum thickening and hypertrophic facet arthropathy causes mild to moderate narrowing of the lumbar_spine canal, most conspicuously the subarticular recesses where disc abuts the traversing L3 nerve roots. This is similar as in 2016. Severe right and moderate left neural foraminal narrowing secondary to facet arthropathy and foraminal disc on the right is also unchanged. Â At L3 - 4: Broad disc bulge in combination with hypertrophic facet arthropathy mild to moderately narrows the spinal canal, similar to previous. Moderate bilateral neural foraminal narrowing secondary to facet arthropathy has increased from previous. Â At L4 - 5: Grade 1 anterolisthesis of L4 and L5 associated facet arthropathy is increased from 2016. This is associated with mild unroofing of the DvD, but no significant posterior Sony_DVDirect bulge. Hypertrophic facet is most prominent on the left where there is marked steepened of the subarticular recess, likely causing some distortion of the traversing L5 nerve root. Moderate left and mild right neural foraminal narrowing secondary to facet arthropathy and small amount of foraminal disc. This has increased from 2016. Â At L5 - S1: Small broad disc bulge, without significant futuristic_frocks the orbits is spinal canal stenosis. Moderate to severe left and moderate right neural foraminal narrowing, similar as in 2016. Â Limited assessment of the visualized paraspinal soft tissues. Atrophic appearance of the left immuno_suppressant_drugs is noted. Â IMPRESSION: 1. Multilevel degenerative change as detailed above with prominent multilevel facet arthropathy. 2. At L3 - 4 and L4 - 5 this has progressed from 2016, with mild to moderate spinal canal narrowing and marked left subarticular recess narrowing respectively. 3. Severe neural foraminal narrowing on the right at L2 - 3 (similar to previous) and the left at L5 - S1 (increased from previous ). Moderate multilevel neural foraminal narrowing elsewhere."

Alignment and vertebral body heights are within normal limits. Modic type I degenerative signal change is seen within the L2 - L4 vertebra, with disc degeneration at these levels, similar to slightly increased from 2018. Allowing for presence of this edema no suspicious marrow replacing lesions are seen. At T11 - 12 and T12 - L1: Small disc protrusions are seen, with no significant spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis. At L1 - 2: Broad disc bulge results in mild narrowing of the spinal canal, unchanged with no evidence of nerve root impingement. Neural foramina are patent. At L2 - 3: Small broad disc bulge in combination with hypertrophic facet arthropathy results in mild to moderate narrowing of the spinal Subernarekha, unchanged. Moderate right and mild left neural foraminal narrowing secondary to facet and endplate osteophyte has slightly increased. At L3 - 4: Small broad disc bulge in combination with hypertrophic facet arthropathy results in mild narrowing of the spinal canal, possibly slightly from October 2018. Severe left neural foraminal narrowing secondary to facet arthropathy and possible foraminal actual of disc appears unchanged. Ya_Wrong neural foramen is patent. At L4 - 5: Small broad disc bulge and mild facet arthropathy. Mild spinal canal narrowing with no evidence of nerve root impingement within the spinal canal. Moderate to severe right and moderate left neural foraminal narrowing secondary to facet arthropathy, possibly some component of endplate osteophyte and disc on the right, similar to previous. At L5 - S1: No significant spinal canal stenosis. Mild left neural foraminal narrowing secondary to facet arthropathy. Limited assessment of the paraspinal soft tissues demonstrates no other significant abnormalities. IMPRESSION: 1. Multilevel osteo_arthritis change in the lumbar spine as described above.

A tiny disc protrusion is present posteriorly, straddling the midline but slightly more prominent to the left of midline, which appears to abut but not significantly compress the ventral surface of the adjacent spinal cord. Degenerative changes are present involving the uncovertebral joint bilaterally. The findings are resulting in moderate compromise of the left neural foramen and mild compromise of the right neural foramen. At the C5 / 6 level, degenerative endplate changes are present along with moderate to advanced narrowing of the intervertebral disc. A small amount of vacuum phenomenon is suspected within the intervertebral disc. Degenerative change is present involving the facet joints which appears to result in a subtle retrolisthesis of the body of C5 with respect to the body of C6 which measures approximately 2 mm.

Â A clinical history of "" chronic back pain since turbo_chargers vehicle accident in 1993 "" has been provided. Â TECHNICAL: Â Sagittal and axial T1 - and T2 - weighted sequences were performed. Â FINDINGS: Â Transitional anatomy is present at the level of the lumbosacral junction. call_#-###-NOW-FALC_###-###-#### the purposes of this report (as well as to remain consistent with the prior radiograph reports ), the inferiormost fully - formed disc will be labeled the L5 / S1 level. Note is made of an underdeveloped disc at the S1 / 2 level as well as an anterolisthesis of the body of L3 with respect to the body of L4. A mild curvature is present convex to the left. The vertebral body heights are well - maintained and appear unchanged in the interval. The bone marrow signal is fairly homogeneous allowing for degenerative endplate changes at several levels, most notably at the L4 / 5 level and at the L3 / 4 level. The conus medullaris terminates normally at approximately the level of the T12 / L1 intervertebral disc. The a small incidental perineural cyst is noted within the sacral spinal canal at the S2 level. Â At the S1 / 2 level, an underdeveloped disc is noted. No significant neural foraminal compromise or compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated. Â At the L5 / S1 level, the intervertebral disc is unremarkable. A pseudoarthrosis with associated degenerative change is present involving the transverse process of L5 with the sacrum on the left side. Mild degenerative changes are present involving the facet postural_muscles. No significant neural foraminal compromise or compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated. Â At the L4 / 5 level, a small anterior osteophyte is noted straddling the midline, more prominent to the left of midline. Degenerative endplate changes are present, more prominent eccentric to the left. Narrowing of the intervertebral disc is present, advanced on the left and mild to moderate on the right. A small amount of vacuum phenomenon is present within the intervertebral disc eccentric to the left. Disc / osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline which extends laterally protruding into the inferior aspect of the neural foramen bilaterally, more prominent on the left side. The posterior remastered_version / osteophyte complex does not appear to involve the traversing L5 nerve roots. Degenerative changes should present involving the facet joints, moderate on the left and mild on the right. There is borderline hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum. The findings are resulting in moderate compromise of the left neural foramen and minimal / mild compromise of the right neural foramen. No significant compromise of the catty_cornered thecal sac is appreciated. Â At the L3 / 4 level, moderate - to - advanced degenerative endplate changes are present along with marked narrowing of the intervertebral disc. Vacuum phenomenon is present within the intervertebral disc. A defect is present within the pars interarticularis bilaterally at the L3 level with an associated anterolisthesis of the body of L3 with respect to the body of L4 measuring approximately 8 mm resulting in uncovering of the posterior aspect of the intervertebral disc. Disc / osteophyte complex is present laterally protruding into the region of the neural foramen bilaterally. Mild degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints. The findings are resulting in severe compromise of the right neural foramen and moderate - to - severe compromise of the left neural foramen. No significant compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated. Â The remainder of the visualized levels is unremarkable allowing for minor degenerative disc and facet joint changes. Â Atheromatous irregularity is highlight involving the abdominal aorta extending into the iliac arteries bilaterally. To the extent visualized, regional soft tissue structures are otherwise unremarkable. Â IMPRESSION: Â Transitional anatomy is present at the level of the lumbosacral junction, as stated above. Radiographic correlation is recommended in an effort to ensure accurate localization, especially prior to any interventional procedure. Â Degenerative change is present involving the intervertebral disc and the facet joints at multiple levels resulting in neural foraminal unyielding_ideological at several levels, most striking bilaterally at the L3 / 4 level as well as on the left side at the L4 / 5 level, as detailed above. Bilateral spondylolysis is present at the L3 level resulting in a grade 2 anterolisthesis of the body of L3 with respect to the body of L4 and associated bilateral neural foraminal compromise, as discussed. The degree of anterolisthesis at the L3 / 4 level appears relatively unchanged when compared with the radiographs performed 17 August, 2020. Â"

A mild degenerative disc bulge is seen at the L2-3 but the thecal sac, spinal canal and  neural foramina are normal.  At L3-4, a moderate degree generalized at degenerative disc bulge is seen.

973,682.0,1,"TECHNIQUE:  Routine lumbar spine sequences with axial T1/T2 sequences from L3-S1 and a further  axial T2 sequence from T12-L3.  CORRELATION:  Comparison is made with the x-rays dated June 15, 2020, and with the MRI dated  August 20, 2017.  FINDINGS:  The lowest complete lumbar disc space is defined as L5-S1 for the purposes of this  report.  There is a slight straightening of the natural lumbar lordosis potentially due to an  element of muscle spasm. Lumbar vertebral height and alignment are otherwise  preserved. No fractures. No spondylolisthesis. There is degenerative disc disease at  L4-5 as detailed below. The remaining lumbar discs are reasonably well preserved,  although there are some prominent anterior endplate osteophytes at L3-4 and smaller  endplate osteophytes at the other lumbar levels.  The conus medullaris lies at L1.  DISCS:  T12-L1 - Minor broad-based posterior disc bulge. No spinal canal or neural foraminal  stenosis.  L1-2 - Normal disc. No spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis.  L2-3 - Normal disc. No spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis.  L3-4 - Normal disc. No spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis. Prominent anterior endplate osteophytes on the left side.  L4-5 - Disc desiccation with mild loss of disc height and a small posterior annular tear.  There is a small broad-based posterior disc bulge. There are severe bilateral facet joint  degenerative changes. There is a 6 mm ovoid lesion at the medial aspect of the right  L4-5 facet joint extending into the lateral recess, likely representing a synovial cyst,  although there is no significant fluid signal. There are congenitally shortened pedicles.  The combination of these findings is resulting in severe spinal stenosis with some  effacement of the posterior epidural fat. There is mild buckling of the cauda equina  proximal to this. There is severe bilateral lateral recess stenosis with impingement on  the descending L5 nerve roots bilaterally. There is mild right neural foraminal  narrowing without exiting nerve root impingement.  L5-S1 - Normal disc. No spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis. Mild bilateral facet  joint degenerative changes.  Other: There is a large exophytic cyst arising from the lower pole of the left kidney,  measuring approximately 7.2 cm in diameter. Probable small exophytic cyst in the  interpolar region of the right kidney.  OPINION:  1. Severe spinal stenosis at L4-5 secondary to a small broad-based posterior  disc bulge, severe facet joint arthropathy and a new 6 mm right L4-5 facet joint  synovial cyst extending into the right lateral recess. The appearances represent a deterioration from the previous MRI.  2. Mild degenerative changes elsewhere within the lumbar spine, but no further  evidence of significant disc bulges, spinal stenosis or neural foraminal stenosis.  3.

974,,1,"MR LUMBAR SPINE Reason for Licensing_Examination: POST MVA SEVERE PAIN WITH BILATERAL HIP RADIATION. ? HERNIATED DISC TECHNIQUE: Sagittal T1 and sagittal T2 - weighted imaging of the lumbar spine was performed. Sagittal T2 weighted imaging of the thoracic spine was also performed. Axial T1 / T2 - weighted imaging was also performed from the level of L3 - S1 and from T9 - T11 with dedicated axial T2 - weighted imaging from T6 / 7 to T11. FINDINGS: MRI THORACIC SPINE: Small Schmorl ' s nodes are noted at T8 with mild anterior wedging of the T8 vertebral body which may relate to previous trauma. Minor anterior wedging of the T9 vertebral bullet_riddled_body is also noted. Tiny ###MC hyperintensities within the T8 and T10 vertebral bodies may relate to underlying hemangiomas or fatty rests. There is otherwise normal alignment of the vertebral bodies and facet joints with no significant loss in vertebral body height. At T9 / 10, a large disc extrusion is noted within the left subarticular region extending into the left lateral and posterior aspect of the epidural space. A small disc component is also noted within the wing_Jack_Skille subarticular region. The thoracic spinal cord is being displaced to the right and is being compressed with abnormal T2 hyperintense signal within the thoracic spinal cord at the level of T9 / 10 compatible with cord edema / myelomalacia. More subtle abnormal T2 hyperintense signal is suspected superiorly to the level of T7 and inferiorly to the level of T11. Mild to moderate left neural foraminal narrowing is also noted. Now T10 / 11, a moderate left subarticular disc extrusion is attested minimally extending superiorly and extending posteriorly along the left lateral epidural space contacting the left lateral aspect of the thoracic spinal cord with no significant spinal canal narrowing. Mild left neural foraminal narrowing is adding noted. At T8 / 9, a tiny right paracentral disc protrusion is noted with no significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing. At T7 / 8, a tiny right paracentral disc protrusion is noted with no significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing. No other significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing is demonstrated within the thoracic spine. MRI LUMBAR SPINE: 5 lumbar - type vertebrae are noted. There is normal alignment of the vertebral bodies and facet joints with no significant loss in vertebral body height. Tiny fatty rests or benign hemangiomas are noted at L2 and L1. The conus medullaris terminates Fridayat the level of L1 / 2. L1 / 2: No significant degenerative disc changes, spinal canal narrowing or neural foraminal narrowing.

L4 / 5: Minor disc bulge is noted with no significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing. L5 / S1: Mild disc bulge is noted with no significant spinal canal narrowing. Mild to moderate bilateral neural foraminal narrowing is noted. IMPRESSION: At T9 / 10, a large disc extrusion is noted within the left subarticular region extending into the left lateral and posterior aspect of the epidural space with a teeny_tiny disc component within the right subarticular region. The thoracic spinal cord is being displaced to the right and is being compressed with abnormal T2 hyperintense signal within the thoracic spinal cord at the level of T9 / 10 compatible with cord edema / myelomalacia. More subtle abnormal T2 hyperintense signal is suspected extending superiorly and inferiorly along the thoracic spinal cord. At T10 / 11, a moderate left subarticular disc extrusion is noted minimally extending superiorly and extending posteriorly along the left lateral epidural space contacting the left lateral aspect of the thoracic spinal cord with no significant spinal canal narrowing. The findings were discussed with Dr. Hajar and a Spinal Surgery / Neurosurgery opinion is recommended."

Alignment and vertebral body heights are within normal limits. Modic type I degenerative signal change is seen within the L2 - L4 vertebra, with disc degeneration at these levels, similar to slightly increased from 2018. Allowing for presence of this occlusive_disease no suspicious marrow replacing lesions are seen. At T11 - 12 and T12 - L1: Small disc protrusions are seen, with no significant spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis.

History of osteoarthritis of the  spine.  Worsening pain.  Discitis?     TECHNIQUE: Sagittal and axial T1 and axial and sagittal T2 sequences were acquired without gadolinium.  After gadolinium, axial  and sagittal T1 fat saturation sequences were obtained.     COMPARISON: MRI of the spine dated November 2, 2009.     FINDINGS:     5 lumbar type vertebrae.  There is mild anterior compression of the T12 vertebra, unchanged compared to a CT scan from June 29,  2017.  Vertebral body heights are otherwise maintained.  Generalized marrow signal is preserved.  Alignment of the spine is  normal. The conus terminates at L1-L2.     At L1-L2 there is mild desiccation of the disc with no significant protrusion.  There is mild bilateral facet joint arthropathy  and ligamentum flavum thickening.  Changes result in no significant spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis.     At L2-L3 there is desiccation of the disc and mild broad-based disc protrusion, asymmetric to the right.  There is also mild  bilateral facet joint arthropathy and ligamentum flavum thickening.  A very small synovial cyst extends medially from the left  facet joint measuring approximately 0.4 x 0.6 cm.  Changes result in moderate spinal canal stenosis with preserved CSF signal  interspersed between the nerve roots.  There is also moderate bilateral neural foraminal stenosis, worse on the right.     At L3-L4 there is desiccation of the disc with broad-based disc protrusion and a superimposed right central/subarticular disc  extrusion that migrates superiorly by approximately 1.4 cm.  Enhancement around the protruded disc is likely related to  granulation tissue.  Mild bilateral facet joint arthropathy and ligament of flavum thickening are also present at this level.  Changes result in moderate spinal canal stenosis.  There is effacement of the right lateral recess and apparent impingement of the  descending right L4 nerve root.  There is severe right and moderate left neural foraminal stenosis.  There are degenerative  changes between the spinous processes of L3 and L4.     At L4-L5 there is broad-based disc protrusion, moderate bilateral facet joint arthropathy and ligamentum flavum thickening.  Changes result in moderate spinal canal stenosis with preserved CSF signal interspersed between the nerve roots.  There is  moderate right and moderate to severe left neural foraminal stenosis. There are degenerative changes between the spinous processes  of L4 and L5.     At L5-S1 there is desiccation of the disc with slight broad-based disc protrusion.  Mild bilateral facet joint arthropathy is  present, worse on the right.  Changes result in no significant spinal canal stenosis.  There is mild to moderate bilateral neural  foraminal stenosis.     SI joints appear unremarkable.     IMPRESSION:     No convincing evidence of discitis/osteomyelitis.  Degenerative changes as described above with moderate spinal canal stenoses at  L2-L3, L3-L4 and L4-L5.  There is a right central/subarticular disc extrusion at L3-L4 with associated enhancing granulation  tissue causing effacement of the right lateral recess and impingement of the descending right L4 nerve root.

FINDINGS:      Reversal of the normal cervical lordosis is present centered at the C4/5 level. Fairly advanced vertebral body height loss is present at the C4 level along with moderate vertebral body height loss at the C3 and C5 levels and mild vertebral body height loss at the C6 level, all of which appear chronic. Otherwise, to the extent visualized, the vertebral body heights are well-maintained. Mild degenerative change is present involving the predental space. Small anterior osteophytes are present extending from the C3/4 level superiorly down through the C6/7 level inferiorly. The cerebellar tonsils appear normal with respect to position.      At the C2/3 level, the intervertebral disc is unremarkable. The neural foramina appear patent.      At the C3/4 level, fairly prominent degenerative endplate changes are present. Degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints which results in an anterolisthesis of the body of C3 with respect to the body of C4 which measures approximately 5 to 6 mm with associated uncovering of the posterior aspect of the intervertebral disc. Disc/osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline which along with hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum results in mild compression of the adjacent thecal sac/spinal cord. Subtle focal abnormal increased T2 signal is present within the adjacent spinal cord compatible with edematous change. Degenerative change is present involving the uncovertebral joint bilaterally. The findings are resulting in fairly advanced neural foraminal compromise bilaterally.      At the C4/5 level, degenerative endplate changes are present along with moderate narrowing of the intervertebral disc. Degenerative change is present involving the facet joints which results in an anterolisthesis of the body of C4 with respect to the body of C5 measuring approximately 3 mm with associated uncovering of the posterior aspect of the intervertebral disc. A tiny disc protrusion is present posteriorly, straddling the midline but slightly more prominent to the left of midline, which appears to abut but not significantly compress the ventral surface of the adjacent spinal cord. Degenerative changes are present involving the uncovertebral joint bilaterally. The findings are resulting in moderate compromise of the left neural foramen and mild compromise of the right neural foramen.      At the C5/6 level, degenerative endplate changes are present along with moderate to advanced narrowing of the intervertebral disc. A small amount of vacuum phenomenon is suspected within the intervertebral disc. Degenerative change is present involving the facet joints which appears to result in a subtle retrolisthesis of the body of C5 with respect to the body of C6 which measures approximately 2 mm. Disc/osteophyte complex is present posteriorly, straddling the midline, which narrows the ventral subarachnoid space. Degenerative change is present involving the uncovertebral joint bilaterally, more prominent on the right side. The findings are resulting in severe compromise of the right neural foramen and at least moderate compromise of the left neural foramen.      At the C6/7 level, degenerative endplate changes are present along with moderate-to-advanced narrowing of the intervertebral disc. Mild disc/osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline, which narrows the ventral subarachnoid space. Degenerative changes are present involving the uncovertebral and facet joints bilaterally, more prominent on the right side. The findings are resulting in moderate compromise of the right neural foramen and mild compromise of the left neural foramen.      At the C7/T1 level, subtle degenerative endplate changes are present. Mild degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints. The findings are resulting in minimal compromise of the left neural foramen. The right neural foramen is patent.      The remainder of the visualized levels are unremarkable.      To the extent visualized, the soft tissues of the neck are unremarkable. Patchy abnormal increased T2 signal is present centrally within the pons which is nonspecific but may simply reflect small-vessel ischemic changes, especially if the patient has a history of hypertension and/or diabetes.

FINDINGS: Comparison made to the MR lumbar spine from September 24, 2016 (UAH ). Lumbar spine x - rays performed September 9, 2019 (Allin Clinic) were also reviewed. Similar curvature of the lumbar spine convex left, centered at L2 - 3. Vertebral body heights are maintained. Small Schmorl ' s nodes within the endplates in the thoracolumbar spine. Marrow signal is unremarkable. No focal destructive osseous lesions. Hypointense T2 disc signal noted within several of the discs, reflecting disc degeneration. At T11 - 12, there is moderate loss of disc height. A small disc - osteophyte complex does not affect the conus or nerve roots. No spinal stenosis or neural foraminal stenosis. At T12 - L1, disc height is maintained. A small posterior disc - osteophyte complex doesn_`_t not affect the conus or nerve roots. No spinal stenosis or significant neural foraminal stenosis. At L1 - 2, disc height is maintained. A small annular disc bulge does not cause any nerve root impingement. Slight narrowing of both neural foramina. No spinal stenosis. Minor facet degenerative changes. At L2 - 3, disc height is maintained. A small annular disc bulge is present, with superimposed small far lateral disc protrusion on the left, encroaching upon the inferior aspect of the left neural foramen, abutting the exiting left L2 disc_bulges root. Mild bilateral facet degenerative changes. No significant lateral recess stenosis or spinal stenosis. Mild stenosis of both neural foramina, more pronounced on the left. Appearances are unchanged. At L3 - 4, there is mild loss of disc height eccentrically towards the right. A small posterior disc bulge indents the thecal sac. Mild bilateral motif degenerative changes with mild ligamentum flavum thickening. Slight narrowing of both knee_flexion recesses and mild narrowing of the left neural foramen but no significant spinal stenosis. Appearances are not significantly changed. At L4 - 5, there is new mild loss of disc height. New grade I spondylolisthesis of 4 mm noted, secondary to severe left - sided and moderate right - sided facet degeneration. The left - sided facet degeneration appears more severe, with osteophyte protruding anteromedially, encroaching upon the left lateral recess. A new, broad - based left paracentral / posterolateral disc extrusion is present, also encroaching upon the left plantar_flexion recess and proximal left neural foramen. As a result, there is now severe stenosis of the left lateral recess including compression of the descending left L5 nerve root. There may be impingement of the exiting left L4 nerve root also. Similar mild narrowing of the right lateral recess. New mild longitudinally narrowing of the thecal sac. More pronounced narrowing of the left neural foramen, now mild to moderate in severity. No significant stenosis of the right neural foramen. At L5 - S1, there is similar mild loss of disc height. A small shallow disc bulge indents the thecal sac. Bilateral facet degenerative changes of mild to moderate severity. No spinal reintervention, significant lateral recess narrowing nor neural foraminal stenosis. Appearances are not significantly changed. Prevertebral soft tissues and visualized sacroiliac achy_muscles are unremarkable. OPINION: 1. More pronounced disc degeneration at L4 - 5. New grade I spondylolisthesis at this level secondary to underlying bilateral (left greater than right) facet degeneration and hypertrophy. New severe stenosis of the left L4 - 5 lateral recess secondary to a combination of facet degeneration and new left - sided disc extrusion, with resultant compression of the descending left L5 nerve root and possible impingement of the exiting left L4 nerve root. 2.

I note that the patient has a history of a left-sided disc herniation.     TECHNICAL:     Sagittal and axial T1 and T2-weighted sequences were performed.     FINDINGS:     This report assumes five lumbar-type vertebrae.  A curvature is present convex to the right which may in part be related to patient positioning.  The vertebral body heights are well maintained.  The bone marrow signal is fairly homogeneous allowing for hemangiomata/fatty rests as well as degenerative endplate changes.  The conus medullaris terminates normally at approximately the L1 level.     At the S1/2 level, an underdeveloped disc is noted.  No significant neural foraminal compromise or compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.     At the L5/S1 level, at least moderate degenerative endplate changes are present along with moderate-to-advanced narrowing of the intervertebral disc.

There is no evidence for Chiari malformation demonstrated. The vertebral artery flow voids are maintained bilaterally. The left vertebral artery is dominant. There is straightening and mild reversal of the cervical lordosis present. The straightening extends from the C1 vertebral body/skull base through to the C6 vertebral body level. Prevertebral and paravertebral soft tissues to the extent visualized are unremarkable. No bulky adenopathy is seen within the neck. Level by level information as follows:     The atlanto-occipital articulations are normally aligned. The atlantodental interval exhibits mild degenerative change. The lateral mass articulation alignment at C1-C2 is preserved. There is evidence of mild degenerative disc disease at C2-3 with loss of disc signal and a tiny central disc protrusion. No significant spinal canal or foraminal stenosis is demonstrated. The facet joints are well maintained.     At C3-4, there is a mild disc bulge with superimposed disc protrusion, similar to the previous examination. This indents the ventral thecal sac resulting in mild contour change of the ventral spinal cord, not significantly changed compared to the previous examination without cord signal change. No foraminal stenosis. Facet joints are unremarkable.     At C4-5, there is degenerative disc disease with loss of intranuclear T2 signal and a tiny central disc protrusion without evidence for spinal canal or foraminal stenosis. The facet joints are unremarkable.     At C5-6, there is a moderate-to-severe degenerative disc disease with diffuse loss of intranuclear T2 signal and a 2 mm retrolisthesis with bilateral uncovertebral joint degenerative changes and mild cord signal change noted within the right lateral hemicord at this level involving the anterior horn gray matter. No abnormal enhancement is seen at this level. The spinal cord is flattened in configuration at this level given a underlying mild-to-moderate spinal canal stenosis. There is severe left and moderate right foraminal stenosis with potential irritation of the exiting C6 nerves bilaterally, left greater than right. Mild bilateral facet arthropathy is noted.     At C6-7, mild-to-moderate degenerative disc disease is present with diffuse loss of intranuclear T2 signal and mild circumferential disc bulge with mild uncovertebral joint degenerative changes bilaterally. Disc bulge results in mild ventral flattening of the spinal cord, asymmetric to the left side, similar to the previous examination. Mild bilateral foraminal stenosis. Mild bilateral degenerative facet joint arthrosis. Otherwise, no change from prior.     At C7-T1, mild reduced intranuclear T2 signal of the disc.

As noted in 2017 the spinal canal is slightly developmentally narrow diffusely.     L5-S1: Prominent left and mild right facet hypertrophy, with disc bulge eccentric to the right and bulky endplate osteophytes. There is left foraminal encroachment. Epidural fat narrows the spinal canal mildly. Appearance is similar to 2017.     L4-5: Prominent bilateral facet hypertrophy with increased osteophyte formation posteriorly since 2017.

Â   TECHNIQUE:  Standard radiculopathy protocol, consisting of sagittal T1 and T2 imaging from T11-12 to the upper sacrum and axial T1 and T2 imaging from L3-4 to L5-S1.  Â   FINDINGS:  Comparison made to the MR lumbar spine from June 2, 2019 (Royal Alexandra Hospital). Lumbar spine x-rays from January 18, 2020 (Sturgeon Hospital) were also reviewed.  Â   Five lumbar type vertebrae are assumed. Grade I spondylolisthesis of L4 on L5 of 5 mm is slightly worse. Alignment is otherwise normal. Marrow signal is normal. Vertebral body heights are maintained. Prevertebral soft tissues are unremarkable.  Â   Conus medullaris is normal, terminating at the L1 level. No fatty filum terminale.  Â   The T11-12 through L2-3 discs are normal. No spinal stenosis or neural foraminal stenosis at these levels.  Â   At L3-4, disc height is preserved. Minor peripheral hypointense T2 disc signal indicative of disc degeneration. Mild annular disc bulging but no nerve root impingement. No spinal stenosis or significant neural foraminal narrowing. Facet joints are unremarkable.  Â   At L4-5, mild loss of disc height is now evident, with similar diffuse hypointense T2 disc signal. There is unroofing of the posterior disc margin, with a small broad-based disc bulge indenting the ventral thecal sac. Small annular fissure at the left posterolateral margin of the disc. Moderately advanced bilateral facet degenerative changes with bilateral joint effusions and mild ligamentum flavum thickening. Combination of these findings results in mild stenoses of both lateral recesses and mild spinal stenosis. Slight narrowing of both neural foramina but no impingement of either exiting L4 nerve root. Appearances are unchanged from the prior MR study.  Â   There is a lobulated T1 hypointense focus demonstrating central hyperintense T2 signal and peripheral incomplete hypointense T2 rim situated at the anterolateral aspect of the left L4-5 facet joint, measuring 8 mm AP x 9 mm TR, consistent with a synovial cyst. It is larger and more conspicuous compared to the 2019 study. It does not affect the exiting left L4 nerve root, latter situated immediately ventral to it. It is remote from the thecal sac.  Â   A synovial cyst measuring 7 mm AP x 15 mm TR is noted posteroinferior to the left L4-5 facet joint, away from the spinal canal and neural foramina, marginally larger compared to the prior study.  Â   At L5-S1, disc height is preserved. Diffuse hypointense T2 disc signal indicative of disc degeneration. Minor annular disc bulging, but no nerve root impingement, spinal stenosis or neural foraminal stenosis. Thin annular fissure along the left posterior paracentral disc margin. Mild facet degenerative changes. Appearances are unchanged.  Â   OPINION:  1. Grade I anterolisthesis at L4-5 is slightly worse. Listhesis is secondary to underlying advanced bilateral facet degeneration. There remains mild spinal stenosis and mild bilateral lateral recess stenoses at this level, unchanged in severity.  Â   2. Synovial cysts adjacent to the left L4-5 facet joint are slightly larger, but do not affect the nerve roots or thecal sac.  Â   3. Stable mild disc degeneration at L3-4 and L5-S1."

1118,807.0,1,"Findings:  Â   Direct comparison is made with the prior lumbar MRI of 2017.  Â   Identification of the L5 segment is defined by the location of the iliolumbar ligament.  Â   A normal conus medullaris terminates at L1 .  Â   Multilevel spondylosis and moderate-to-severe degenerative disc disease are again seen.  This has progressed in some levels.  Â   Degenerative bone marrow signal change is evident in multiple levels.  No other significant abnormality of bone marrow signal is seen.  Â   Central canal is reduced in two levels as discussed below.  Â   In T11-12, a chronic broad posterior disc-osteophyte complex results in mild central stenosis with some distortion of cord and thecal sac contour.  This may be the etiology of the thoracic myelopathy described on the history for the 2017 MRI request.  However, cord signal remains normal, showing no edema or evidence for myelomalacia.  The mild stenosis appears relatively stable.  Â   In T12-L1 and in L1-2, minor broad posterior disc bulges are stable, causing no neural compromise.  The facet joints show minor degenerative change without definite osteoarthritis.  Â   In L2-3, severe disc degeneration has nearly obliterated the intervertebral disc, representing a significant adverse change from 2017 when the disc was near normal.  There is minor retrolisthesis.  A broad posterior disc bulge associated with the disc degeneration is slightly eccentric towards the right side.  There is now mild central stenosis, with slight distortion in the thecal sac contour.  However, no convincing nerve root compromise is seen, as perineural fat is still preserved bilaterally with respect to exiting and descending nerves.  Mild/moderate osteoarthritis of the bilateral facet joints is present.  Â   Previously seen fluid between spinous processes of L2 and L3 has resolved, leaving advanced degenerative change.  Â   L3-4 remains stable.  A broad posterior disc bulge slightly indents the ventral thecal sac but does not cause any convincing neural compromise.  Previously suggested mild central stenosis shows no adverse change.  Moderately severe bilateral facet OA is evident.  Â   L4-5 is stable.  The broad posterior disc bulge indents the ventral thecal sac but does not cause convincing neural compromise.  The previously described mild bilateral foraminal stenosis shows no progression.  Perineural fat is still preserved.  Severe bilateral facet OA is again evident, with minimal degenerative grade 1 anterolisthesis which was previously present.  Â   L5-S1 is stable.  The minimal broad posterior disc bulge barely touches the thecal sac because of the capacious size of the central canal in this level.  Neural elements remain fully intact with no compromise.  Severe bilateral facet OA is again seen.  Â   Impression:  Â   Multilevel degenerative disc disease and spondylosis are again seen.  The only adverse change from 2017 is the development of new severe degenerative disc disease in L2-3 which was previously near normal.  Â   The above produces a new level of mild central stenosis.  Â   Prior mild central stenosis in T11-T12 remains stable; while there may still be mild cord compression, the cord does not show any edema or evidence of myelomalacia.  Clinical correlation is required regarding any persistence of the thoracic myelopathy clinically described in 2017.  Â   Again no other potential neural compromise is seen on this study, and there is no specific site of convincing nerve root compromise.  Â   Moderate to severe facet OA is present in most levels."

BUT SHE GOT SICK. ?SPINAL STENOSIS      HISTORY:  As above.     TECHNIQUE:  Standard radiculopathy protocol, consisting of sagittal T1 and T2 imaging from T9 to the upper sacrum and axial T1 and T2 imaging from L3-4 to L5-S1.     FINDINGS:  Comparison made to the MR lumbar spine from April 26, 2016 (Grey Nuns Hospital). Lumbar spine x-rays performed December 5, 2016 (St. Paul HCC) and CT abdomen/pelvis from August 27, 2018 (Cold Lake HCC) were also reviewed.     Five lumbar vertebrae are assumed. Moderate curvature of the lumbar spine convex right centered at L3-4. Vertebral body heights are maintained. No focal destructive osseous lesions.     The lower thoracic spinal cord and conus medullaris are suboptimally assessed due to motion artifact. They appear grossly normal in caliber. Conus terminates in a normal fashion at the L1 level. No fatty filum terminale.     Hypointense T2 signal noted within most of the lower thoracic and lumbar discs, indicative of underlying disc degeneration.     Similar tiny posterior disc protrusions are present at the T9-10, T10-11 and T11-12 levels, indenting the thecal sac but not affecting the spinal cord or nerve roots. No spinal stenosis or significant neural foraminal narrowing at these levels.     At T12-L1, disc height is preserved. Mild annular disc bulging is present. No nerve root impingement, spinal stenosis or neural foraminal stenosis. Minor facet degenerative changes.     At L1-2, there is similar subtle retrolisthesis of L1 on L2. Mild loss of disc height eccentrically towards the right. A small right paracentral disc-osteophyte complex indents the thecal sac but does not affect the conus. Moderate stenosis of the right neural foramen noted. No stenosis of the left neural foramen. No spinal stenosis. Minor facet degenerative changes. Appearances are not significantly changed.     At L2-3, disc height is reasonably well-maintained. A small broad-based posterior disc-osteophyte complex indents the ventral thecal sac and encroaches upon the inferior aspects of both neural foramina, resulting in bilateral neural foraminal stenoses of mild to moderate severity. Mild to moderate left-sided and minor right-sided facet degenerative changes. Slight narrowing of the left lateral recess. No stenosis of the right lateral recess. No spinal stenosis. Appearances are not significantly changed.     At L3-4, there remains moderate loss of disc height laterally towards the left with associated moderately advanced degenerative endplate changes. Moderate left-sided and mild right-sided facet degenerative changes and mild ligamentum flavum thickening also noted. A small broad-based disc-osteophyte complex indents the ventral thecal sac. Moderate stenosis of the left lateral recess and moderate to severe narrowing of the left neural foramen noted. Minor narrowing of the right neural foramen. Right lateral recess remains normal in caliber. No significant spinal stenosis. Appearances overall are not significantly changed.     At L4-5, disc height is well-maintained. Bilateral moderate to severe facet degenerative changes are present with ligamentum flavum thickening. A small broad-based posterior disc-osteophyte complex indents the ventral thecal sac. A 6 mm circumscribed focus of hyperintense T1 and T2 signal situated along the anteromedial aspect of the right facet joint is unchanged. This corresponds to a either a small focus of ossification or calcified synovial cyst on the CT scan, contributing to moderate to severe right lateral recess stenosis. There is mild transverse narrowing of the thecal sac posteriorly. No significant left lateral recess narrowing. Mild stenoses of both neural foramina. Appearances overall are similar to the prior MR study.     At L5-S1, there is grade 1-2 spondylolisthesis of 6 mm, worse compared to the 2016 study. Disc height is reasonably well-maintained. There is unroofing of the posterior disc margin, with a small shallow disc bulge indenting the ventral thecal sac. There is severe degeneration of the left facet joint, with severe joint space narrowing and adjacent sclerosis and bony overgrowth evident. Moderate degeneration of the right facet joint also noted. Unilateral right-sided spondylolysis of L5 is again evident. Combination of these findings results in bilateral lateral recess stenoses of at least moderate severity and moderate spinal stenosis. There is severe stenosis of the right neural foramen with virtually complete effacement of the perineural fat and compression and flattening of the exiting right L5 nerve root. Moderate to severe stenosis of the left neural foramen also noted.     Mild degenerative changes noted within the visualized sacroiliac joints. Prevertebral soft tissues are unremarkable.     OPINION:  1. Spondylolisthesis of L5 on S1 is slightly worse compared to the 2016 MR examination. Anterolisthesis is secondary to a combination of right L5 spondylolysis and bilateral facet degeneration. Facet degeneration is severe on the left side. There is severe stenosis of the right L5-S1 neural foramen with compression of the exiting right L5 nerve root. Moderate to severe stenosis of the left neural foramen, bilateral lateral recess stenoses of moderate severity and moderate spinal stenosis at this level also.     2. Multilevel degenerative disc disease in the remainder of the spine is of similar severity, as detailed above. Moderate to severe stenosis of the right lateral recess at L4-5 secondary to a combination of disc degeneration, facet degeneration and small focus of ossification (or synovial cyst with peripheral calcification) at the anteromedial aspect of the right facet joint. Spinal stenosis of moderate severity at L4-5 also."

Vertebral body heights are maintained.  No acute compression fractures.  Conus terminates at approximately L1, within normal limits.  Patchy heterogenous marrow signal, similar to previous.     T12-L1: No spinal canal stenosis.     L-1-L2: No spinal canal stenosis.  Disc height is maintained.     L2-L3: Moderate disc space narrowing.  Posterior disc osteophyte complex eccentric to the left abuts the ventral thecal sac and results in mild narrowing of the left lateral recess.  No significant spinal canal stenosis.  The right neural foramina is patent.  Disc material extends into inferior left neural foramina resulting in mild/moderate stenosis.  Mild left facet arthropathy.     L3-L4: Severe loss of disc height.  Small posterior disc osteophyte complex abuts the ventral thecal sac.

Right   neural foramen is patent.  No central canal compromise identified.       C6-7: The intervertebral disc space is maintained.  There does appear to be a more focal disc protrusion/extrusion in a right   paracentral location.  The posterior longitudinal ligament appears to be expanded and is widened in the AP dimension from the   level of the top of C6 2 the upper third of the C7 vertebral body posteriorly.  This produces a convexity which indents the   anterior aspect of the cervical cord at the C6-7 level.  There is tapering of the cord at this level as well as some altered   increased T2 signal identified within.       C7-T1: The intervertebral disc spaces maintained.  No central canal or neural foraminal compromise identified.       IMPRESSION: Slightly unusual appearance identified at C6-7 where there does appear to be a focal disc protrusion in a left   paracentral location.  I suspect that there is a small defect in the posterior longitudinal ligament allowing the focal herniation  to extend into/through the ligament with further extrusion in a superior and inferior direction at the posterior aspect of the   posterior longitudinal ligament this results in a posterior convexity indenting the cervical cord resulting in deformation of the   cord and some signal change within the substance of the cord in keeping with high-grade central canal stenosis.  Recommend urgent   neurosurgical opinion.    Alternatively, although much less likely, this could represent a focal disc as well as a intra-axial   lesion such as a meningioma.  An enhanced study may help in further clarification.       Asymmetric disc ossific bulges identified posterior A on the left at C4-5 C5-6 which results in mild narrowing of the left neural  foramina at these levels."

Note is made of recent nuclear medicine white cell scan performed for rule out septic joints with multifocal musculoskeletal pain and increased CRP.     COMPARISON: Nuclear medicine white cell scan completed earlier today, MRI lumbar spine December 29, 2012, radiographs of the lumbar spine August 1, 2018     TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar multi with MRI of the entire spine with and without gadolinium     FINDINGS:  There are 7 cervical, 12 thoracic, and 5 lumbar type vertebra. Conus medullaris is not optimally seen, but appears to terminate around the L1 level.     Mild reversal cervical lordosis and mild anterolisthesis of C3 on C4, favored to be chronic. Moderate left convex curvature of the lumbar spine centered at L4 due to height loss in the right side of the L4 vertebra appears unchanged from April 6, 2020, mildly increased from August 1, 2018. Grade 1 anterolisthesis of L5 on S1 is also unchanged and is associated with bilateral pars intra-articular is defects and severe facet arthropathy on CT.     Cervical:  Marrow signal is diffusely decreased. There is subtle STIR hyperintensity and minor enhancement within the C3-C6 vertebra, with multilevel associated degenerative change. Multiple small disc osteophyte formations are seen in the cervical spine, with no significant spinal canal stenosis. Cervical neural foramina are not well assessed on this study due to technique.     Small (2.1 x 2.7 mm) cystic-appearing focus within the paraspinal musculature to the left of midline the C7-T1 level is nonenhancing and incompletely visualized, presumably just a small incidental cyst. No surrounding enhancement or edema. Visualized posterior fossa structures, cervical spinal cord, and other paraspinal soft tissues are grossly unremarkable.     Thoracic:  No osseous edema or abnormal osseous enhancement in the thoracic spine. No significant spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis is identified in the thoracic region the thoracic spinal cord appears normal in caliber and signal intensity within the limits of this study.      Limited assessment of the thoracic paraspinal soft tissues demonstrates no other significant abnormalities.     Lumbar:  Modic type II degenerative endplate signal change without significant enhancement at the L2-3 level. Mild edema and enhancement of the endplates on either side of the L3-4 disc space. Prominent Schmorl's nodes suspected in the superior endplate of L4. Modic type II degenerative endplate signal change without significant enhancement or edema in the endplates about the L4-5 disc space. Mild edema and enhancement slight endplate irregularity about the L5-S1 disc space. Severe multilevel arthropathy with most prominently on the right at L3-4 through L5-S1 where there is mild osseous edema and enhancement. This most conspicuously involves the right L3-4 facet with some loss of cortex in either side of the joint. There is prominent edema and enhancement within the paraspinal muscles adjacent to these facets. Minimal fluid within the L1-2 through L5-S1 disc spaces.     At T12-L1 and L1-2: Small posterior disc bulges without significant spinal canal stenosis.     At L2-3: Small posterior disc bulge in combination with hypertrophic facet arthropathy mildly narrows the spinal canal. Moderate left and mild right neural foraminal narrowing secondary to facet arthropathy.     At L3-4: Small broad disc bulge and endplate osteophyte and combination with severe right more than left hypertrophic facet arthropathy moderately narrows the central portion the spinal canal. Further enhancing tissue presumably extending from the adjacent facet joint effaces the right neural foramina and subarticular recess, which are both significantly narrow potentially causing impingement upon the right L3 and L4 nerve roots respectively. Moderate to severe left neural foraminal narrowing.     At L4-5: Small broad disc bulge and marked hypertrophic facet arthropathy, narrowing the left more than right subarticular recess but not significantly narrowing the central portion the spinal canal. Severe left and moderate to severe right neural foraminal narrowing secondary to the facet arthropathy. There could also be some distortion of the left L5 nerve root within the subarticular recess.     At L5-S1: Grade 1 anterolisthesis associated bilateral pars interarticularis defects and severe facet arthropathy. There is only mild narrowing of the spinal canal. Severe bilateral neural foraminal narrowing secondary to the facet arthropathy and listhesis.     Limited assessment of the visualized paraspinal soft tissues demonstrates no additional significant abnormalities.     IMPRESSION:  1.  Complex study revealing no convincing single focal source of infection arising from the spine. Advanced degenerative change in the lumbar spine. Mild enhancement within the C3-C6 vertebra, within the endplates on either side of the L1-2, L3-4, and L5-S1 disc spaces, and in the right L3-4 through L5-S1 facets could largely reflect changes of active arthropathy. However, a low-grade or multifocal infection particularly at the lumbar sites of enhancement would be difficult to exclude on MRI. The most prominent finding is cortical irregularity and significant adjacent soft tissue and epidural enhancement surrounding the right L3-4 facet joint, which could reflect infection but is of less certain significance given extent of findings elsewhere.     2.  Multilevel degenerative change in the lumbar spine as detailed. As described there potential nerve root impingement in the spinal canal at L3-4 and in the neural foramina at L3-4 through L5-S1.     3.  Diffuse decreased marrow signal suggestive of marrow infiltrative process such as myelofibrosis or diffuse red marrow conversion in the setting of severe chronic anemia. Correlate clinically."

No nerve root impingement is identified.     At the L1-2 level there is decreased T2 signal in the intervertebral disc indicating mild disc desiccation.  A tiny broad-based posterior disc bulge is present.  This does not cause any compromise to the spinal canal caliber or to the neural foramina.  Some minor degenerative change is present within the facet joints.     At the L2-3 level there is a small broad-based posterior disc bulge.  This causes some mild indentation on the anterior aspect of the thecal sac but no significant spinal stenosis.  There is some mild degenerative change within the facet joints.  No nerve root impingement is identified at this level.     At the L3-4 level there is severe loss of disc height.  There is uncovering of the posterior aspect of the intervertebral disc accompanied by a small broad-based posterior disc bulge.  There is hypertrophic degenerative change of moderate severity within both facet joints.  A combination of the posterior element hypertrophic changes and the anterolisthesis  produced some mild spinal stenosis and some moderate foraminal stenosis on the left and severe foraminal stenosis on the right.

There are normal appearances of the craniocervical junction.        There are T2 hyperintense signals projecting over the cervical cord on the sagittal T2 space, these are inconsistent between the scans and therefore felt to be artifacts. No definite cervical cord lesion is identified.      The remainder of the cord, which terminates at the level of the T12-L1 intervertebral disc space, returns normal signal and is of normal dimensions.  Unremarkable appearances of the conus medullaris and the cauda equina.  No intradural or extradural mass identified.      There is straightening of cervical lordosis.
