18,0,"Narrative & Impression  MR LUMBAR SPINE      Reason for Exam: PATIENT HAS BACK PAIN THAT RADIATES DOWN BACK OF LEFT LOWER LEG. MISSING KNEE REFLEX ON LEFT. QUERY LEFT-SIDED SCIATICA.     HISTORY:  As above.     TECHNIQUE:  Standard radiculopathy protocol, consisting of sagittal T1 and T2 imaging from T11-12 to the mid sacrum and axial T1 and T2 imaging from L3-4 to L5-S1.     FINDINGS:  Comparison made to the MR lumbar spine from January 28, 2015 (Royal Alexandra Hospital) and lumbar spine x-rays from October 11, 2018 (Insight Medical Imaging).     Five lumbar vertebrae are assumed. Similar minimal curvature of the lumbar spine convex left. Vertebral body heights are maintained. Similar mild degenerative endplate changes noted ventrally at the L2-3 level, associated with small osteophytes. No marrow abnormalities of concern in the remainder of the spine.     Conus medullaris is normal, terminating at the L1 level.     No significant disc bulging or herniation noted at the T11-12, T12-L1 or L1-2 levels.     At L2-3, there is a small annular disc bulge indenting the thecal sac but not causing any nerve root impingement. Slight narrowing of both neural foramina but no impingement of the exiting L2 nerve roots. No spinal stenosis.     At L3-4, disc height is maintained. A small annular disc bulge is present, mildly indenting the thecal sac and slightly encroaching upon the inferior aspect of both neural foramina, but not causing any focal nerve root impingement. No significant facet degenerative changes. No spinal stenosis or lateral recess stenosis.     At L4-5, disc height is maintained. Mild annular disc bulging is present, resulting in slight encroachment upon the inferior aspect of both neural foramina but no impingement of the exiting L4 nerve roots. Mild bilateral facet degenerative changes. No spinal stenosis or lateral recess narrowing.     At L5-S1, there is slight loss of disc height with diffuse hypointense T2 disc signal indicative of disc degeneration. A small shallow central disc-osteophyte complex abuts the thecal sac. The small posterolateral disc extrusion situated paracentrally on the left, protruding inferiorly, demonstrated on the previous MR study, has almost completely resolved. A tiny residual/recurrent left posterolateral disc protrusion remains, indenting but not displacing the descending left S1 nerve root. The left S2 nerve root is no longer compressed. Similar mild stenosis of the left neural foramen. Right neural foramen remains of reasonable caliber. Similar mild degenerative changes of both facet joints. No spinal stenosis.     Visualized sacroiliac joints are unremarkable. Prevertebral soft tissues are unremarkable.     OPINION:  Previously demonstrated left-sided disc extrusion/sequestration at L5-S1 is no longer evident. A tiny left posterolateral disc protrusion remains at this level, indenting the descending left S1 nerve root within the lateral recess. No new superimposed abnormality. No spinal stenosis at any level.     _____________________________________________________________  Electronically Verified by Sandeep Naik on 11/12/2018 6:16 PM"

L  -L4, 2009  †  An MRI of the lumbar spine performed 19 September, 2014 is available for comparison.  †  A clinical history of ""severe spinal stenosis for possible surgery"" has been provided.  †  TECHNICAL:  †  Sagittal and axial T1- and T2-weighted sequences were performed.  †  FINDINGS:  †  This report assumes five lumbar-type vertebrae. A subtle curvature is present convex to the right which may in part be related to patient positioning. The vertebral body heights are relatively well-maintained allowing for Schmorl's node formation associated with the endplates throughout the lumbar region and are stable in appearance when compared with the prior study performed in September of 2014. The bone marrow signal is fairly homogeneous allowing for hemangiomata/fatty rests as well as degenerative endplate changes at several levels. There is evidence for a prior posterior decompression procedure at the L4 level with associated postoperative changes within the overlying soft tissues posterior to the osseous spinal column. The conus medullaris terminates normally at approximately the L1 level.  †  At the S1/2 level, an underdeveloped disc is noted. No significant neural foraminal compromise or compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.  †  At the L5/S1 level, a prominent anterior osteophyte is noted straddling the midline. Moderate degenerative endplate changes are present along with moderate-to-advanced narrowing of the intervertebral disc. A trace amount of vacuum phenomenon is suspected within the intervertebral disc. Disc/osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline which extends laterally protruding into the inferior aspect of the neural foramen bilaterally. A minuscule focus of abnormal increased T2 signal is present within the disc annulus posteriorly to the right of midline, compatible with an annular fissure. Degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints, mild-to-moderate on the left and mild on the right. The findings are resulting in moderate-to-severe compromise of the right neural foramen and moderate compromise of the left neural foramen. No significant compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.  †  At the L4/5 level, moderate degenerative endplate changes are present, more prominent eccentric to the left. Narrowing of the intervertebral disc is present, fairly advanced on the left and moderate on the right. Disc/osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline which extends laterally protruding into the inferior aspect of the neural foramen bilaterally. The posterior disc/osteophyte complex appears to involve the traversing L5 nerve root bilaterally, more prominent on the left side. Moderate degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints. There is hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum. The findings are resulting in moderate compromise of the adjacent thecal sac as well as severe compromise of the right neural foramen and moderate inferior neural foraminal compromise on the left. Subtle clumping of the nerve roots is noted within the thecal sac at this level, raising the possibility of arachnoiditis.  †  At the L3/4 level, moderate degenerative endplate changes are present, more prominent eccentric to the left. Narrowing of the intervertebral disc is present, advanced on the left and moderate-to-advanced on the right. Disc/osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline which extends laterally protruding into the inferior aspect of the neural foramen bilaterally, slightly more striking on the left side. A superimposed small disc extrusion persists posteriorly straddling the midline, but more prominent to the left of midline, which has diminished in size when compared with the prior study and likely involves the traversing L4 nerve root. Mild degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints. The findings are resulting in the severe compromise of the left neural foramen and mild-to-moderate compromise of the right neural foramen as well as minimal/mild compromise of the adjacent thecal sac.  †  At the L2/3 level, a prominent anterior osteophyte is noted straddling the midline. Moderate degenerative endplate changes are present, more prominent eccentric to the right. Narrowing of the intervertebral disc is present, advanced on the right and moderate on the left. Disc/osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline which extends laterally protruding into the inferior aspect of the neural foramen bilaterally. A minuscule focus of abnormal increased T2 signal is noted within the disc annulus posteriorly, compatible with an annular fissure. The posterior disc/osteophyte complex appears to contact but not significantly displace the traversing L3 nerve roots. Mild-to-moderate degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints. The findings are resulting in moderate compromise of the left neural foramen and mild compresses of the right neural foramen. No significant compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.  †  At the L1/2 level, a small anterior osteophyte is noted straddling the midline. Mild degenerative endplate changes are present along with mild-to-moderate narrowing of the intervertebral disc. A minuscule shallow disc protrusion is present posteriorly in the midline which does not appear to involve the traversing L2 nerve roots. Minor disc/osteophyte complex is present laterally protruding into the inferior aspect of the right neural foramen. Mild degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints. The findings are resulting in minimal compromise of the right neural foramen. The left neural foramen is patent and no significant compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.  †  The remainder of the visualized levels are unremarkable allowing for at least mild degenerative facet joint changes.  †  Atheromatous irregularity is present throughout the abdominal aorta extending into the iliac arteries bilaterally. Diffuse atrophic change is present involving the posterior paraspinal musculature, most prominent inferior to the L4/5 level. To the extent visualized, the regional soft tissue structures are otherwise unremarkable.  †  IMPRESSION:  †  Findings compatible with the prior posterior decompression procedure at the L4 level.

MRI - SEP 2016 - SLIGHT NERVE ROOT IRRITATION OF L L5 NERVE ROOT. HISTORY: As above. TECHNIQUE: Standard radiculopathy protocol, consisting of sagittal T1 and T2 imaging from T11 - 12 to the mid sacrum and axial T1 and T2 imaging from L1 - 2 to L5 - S1. FINDINGS: Comparison made to the MR lumbar spine from September 24, 2016 (UAH ). Lumbar spine x - rays performed September 9, 2019 (Allin Clinic) were also reviewed. Similar curvature of the lumbar spine convex left, centered at L2 - 3. Vertebral body heights are maintained. Small Schmorl ' s nodes within the endplates in the thoracolumbar spine. Marrow signal is unremarkable. No focal destructive osseous lesions. Hypointense T2 disc signal noted within countless of the discs, reflecting disc degeneration. At T11 - 12, there is moderate loss of disc height. A small disc - osteophyte complex does not affect the conus or spinal_chord roots. No spinal stenosis or neural foraminal stenosis. At T12 - L1, disc height is maintained. A small posterior disc - osteophyte complex does not affect the conus or nerve roots. No spinal stenosis or significant neural foraminal stenosis. At L1 - 2, disc height is maintained. A small annular disc bulge does not cause any nerve root impingement. Slight narrowing of both neural foramina. No spinal stenosis. Minor facet degenerative adjustments. At L2 - 3, disc height is maintained. A small annular disc bulge is present, with superimposed small far lateral disc protrusion on the left, encroaching upon every inferior aspect of the left neural foramen, abutting the exiting left L2 nerve root. Mild bilateral therein_lies degenerative changes. No significant lateral legislature_reconvenes stenosis or spinal stenosis. Mild stenosis of both neural foramina, more pronounced on the left. Appearances are unchanged. At L3 - 4, there is mild loss of disc height eccentrically towards the right. A small posterior disc bulge indents the thecal sac. Mild bilateral facet degenerative changes with mild ligamentum flavum thickening. Slight narrowing of both lateral recesses and mild narrowing of the fielder_Jose_Tabata neural foramen but no significant spinal stenosis. Appearances are not significantly changed. At L4 - 5, there is new mild loss of disc height. New grade I spondylolisthesis of 4 mm noted, secondary to severe left - sided and moderate right - sided facet degeneration. The left - sided facet degeneration appears more severe, with osteophyte protruding anteromedially, encroaching upon the left lateral recess. A new, broad - based left paracentral / posterolateral disc extrusion is present, also encroaching upon the left lateral recess and proximal left neural foramen. As a result, there is now severe stenosis of the left lateral recess with compression of the descending left L5 nerve root. There may be impingement of the exiting left L4 nerve root also. Similar mild narrowing of the right lateral recess. New mild transverse narrowing of the thecal sac. More pronounced narrowing of the left neural foramen, now mild to moderate in severity. No significant stenosis of the right neural foramen. At L5 - S1, there is similar mild loss of disc height. A small shallow disc bulge indents the thecal sac. Bilateral facet degenerative changes of mild to moderate severity. No spinal stenosis, significant lateral recess narrowing nor neural foraminal stenosis. Appearances are not significantly changed. Prevertebral soft tissues and comprehended sacroiliac joints are unremarkable. OPINION: 1. More pronounced disc degeneration at L4 - 5. New grade I spondylolisthesis at this level secondary to underlying bilateral (left greater than right) facet degeneration and hypertrophy. New severe stenosis of the left L4 - 5 lateral recess secondary to a combination of facet degeneration and new left - sided disc extrusion, with resultant compression of the descending left L5 nerve root and possible impingement of the exiting left L4 nerve root. 2. Degenerative disc disease within the remainder of the spine is of similar severity compared to the 2016 MR journal_Appetite."

No evidence of any lipoma nor any other abnormality in the spinal canal. The L1 - L2 disc space is slightly reduced and this is associated with a mild disc mildly_alkaline and a quite small posterior central annular tear which is causing a slight generalized disc bulge. This is a new finding. No evidence of disc protrusion. The ventral thecal sac is minimally compressed but the spinal cord is normal. At L2 - L3, moderate degree generalized degenerative disc bulge and disc desiccation are seen along with the slight reduction in the disc space. In addition, there is a mild to moderate size posterior - central and left parasagittal disc extrusion. The extruded disc measures 1. 2 cm in the transverse and 6 mm in AP dimensions.

128,0,"TECHNIQUE: A routine lumbar spine protocol is performed.  †  FINDINGS:  †  The conus medullaris is appropriately situated at the T12-L1 level. No abnormality of signal or contour is identified within the distal cord or conus. Vertebral alignment is well maintained. Intervertebral disc spaces are well maintained. The intervertebral discs within the lower thoracic and upper lumbar spine as far distally as and including the L3-4 level, there is no disc bulge present. The spinal canal caliber is well maintained. Neural foramina are well maintained. There is no nerve root impingement. Facet joints are unremarkable.  †  At L4-5 level, there is mild decrease in T2 signal indicating early disc desiccation. There is a broad-based posterior disc protrusion which causes indentation upon the anterior aspect of the thecal sac. There is mild hypertrophy of ligamentum flavum at this level and these features produce mild spinal canal stenosis. In particular, there is some significant narrowing of the lateral recesses, more prominent on the left than on the right. This may cause some impingement upon the traversing L5 nerve roots. The disc bulge at this level produces some mild stenosis of the inferior aspects of the left neural foramen and some moderate stenosis of the right neural foramen in the absence of any nerve root impingement.  †  At the L5-S1 level, there is decreased T2 signal within the intervertebral disc indicating disc desiccation. There is a small broad-based posterior disc bulge which is slightly more prominent to the right of the midline. The disc bulge contains a tiny annular tear. The disc bulge does not cause any significant spinal stenosis. The neural foramina are mildly narrowed bilaterally in the absence of any direct nerve root impingement. There is some mild degenerative change within the facet joints.  †  CONCLUSION: There is disc degeneration at the L4-5 and L5-S1 levels. At the L4-5 level, disc bulge produces some narrowing of the spinal canal caliber and in particular, of the lateral recesses. There is potential for impingement upon the bilateral traversing L5 nerve roots. At the L5-S1 level, a small broad-based posterior disc bulge contains a tiny annular tear. There is mild degenerative change within the L5-S1 facet joints.  †  The Workers' Compensation Board has requested that we provide a professional opinion as to whether the imaging findings are related whole or in part to the injury in question.  This is not considered part of the official diagnostic imaging report, and will only be used to help a WCB caseworker decide whether the injury is work-related or not. My opinion is:  †  Some of the imaging findings could be related to the patient's injury."

Five lumbar vertebrae of normal morphology are visualized. The lumbar spine lordosis is maintained. Vertebral body heights are preserved.  No suspicious bone marrow signal abnormality.  The conus medullaris is normal in appearance and terminates at the L1 vertebral body level.        Of note, the incompletely assessed uterus appears bulky and a possible submucosal fibroid is seen, distorting the endometrial lining.      Levels T10-T11 to L1-L2 are unremarkable.  The patient tiny posterior disc bulge is present at L2-L3.  Neural foramina remain patent.  No spinal canal stenosis.      No abnormal enhancement seen on post gadolinium imaging.      L3-4:   8 mm anterolisthesis of L3 on L4 associated with superior uncovering of the disc posteriorly. There is a superimposed small posterior central disc protrusion. Adjacent endplates show diffuse low T1 signal.  Evidence of the right hemilaminectomy.  Advanced left facet hypertrophic osteoarthritis is present and a 7 x 5 x 7 mm (AP x TR x CC) presumed synovial cyst protrudes anteromedially into the spinal canal, further contributing to the overall moderate to severe spinal canal stenosis.  A linear area of increased T2 signal is also seen about the right facet joint medially, possibly representing a recurrent or residual synovial cyst.  The left lateral recess is obliterated, accounting for compression of the left L4 traversing nerve root.  There is moderate left and mild right neural foramina narrowing.      L4-5:    There is a small central disc extrusion indenting the anterior aspect of the thecal sac.  Advanced left facet hypertrophic osteoarthritis is present with asymmetrical thickening of the ligamentum flavum, further contributing to the distortion of the spinal canal.  No spinal canal stenosis. The previously visualized synovial cyst arising from the right facet joint has been surgically removed.  Lateral recesses remain patent.  There is mild left neural foramen narrowing.      L5-S1:   Disc height is severely reduced and pronounced surrounding endplate osteophytes are present.

Ç†  TECHNIQUE:  Standard radiculopathy protocol, consisting of sagittal T1 and T2 imaging from T11-12 to the upper sacrum and axial T1 and T2 imaging from L3-4 to L5-S1.  Ç†  FINDINGS:  Comparison made to the MR lumbar spine from June 2, 2019 (Royal Alexandra Hospital). Lumbar spine x-rays from January 18, 2020 (Sturgeon Hospital) were also reviewed.  Ç†  Five lumbar type vertebrae are assumed. Grade I spondylolisthesis of L4 on L5 of 5 mm is slightly worse. Alignment is otherwise normal. Marrow signal is normal. Vertebral body heights are maintained. Prevertebral soft tissues are unremarkable.  Ç†  Conus medullaris is normal, terminating at the L1 level. No fatty filum terminale.  Ç†  The T11-12 through L2-3 discs are normal. No spinal stenosis or neural foraminal stenosis at these levels.  Ç†  At L3-4, disc height is preserved. Minor peripheral hypointense T2 disc signal indicative of disc degeneration. Mild annular disc bulging but no nerve root impingement. No spinal stenosis or significant neural foraminal narrowing. Facet joints are unremarkable.  Ç†  At L4-5, mild loss of disc height is now evident, with similar diffuse hypointense T2 disc signal. There is unroofing of the posterior disc margin, with a small broad-based disc bulge indenting the ventral thecal sac. Small annular fissure at the left posterolateral margin of the disc. Moderately advanced bilateral facet degenerative changes with bilateral joint effusions and mild ligamentum flavum thickening. Combination of these findings results in mild stenoses of both lateral recesses and mild spinal stenosis. Slight narrowing of both neural foramina but no impingement of either exiting L4 nerve root. Appearances are unchanged from the prior MR study.  Ç†  There is a lobulated T1 hypointense focus demonstrating central hyperintense T2 signal and peripheral incomplete hypointense T2 rim situated at the anterolateral aspect of the left L4-5 facet joint, measuring 8 mm AP x 9 mm TR, consistent with a synovial cyst. It is larger and more conspicuous compared to the 2019 study. It does not affect the exiting left L4 nerve root, latter situated immediately ventral to it. It is remote from the thecal sac.  Ç†  A synovial cyst measuring 7 mm AP x 15 mm TR is noted posteroinferior to the left L4-5 facet joint, away from the spinal canal and neural foramina, marginally larger compared to the prior study.

No vertebral body compression fracture.      Visualized posterior fossa structures are unremarkable.      At C2-3 there are no significant degenerative changes. No neural compromise.      At C3-4 there is a posterior disc osteophyte complex with left paracentral-foraminal prominence. Moderate facet joint arthropathy. In combination there is mild spinal canal stenosis with focal impingement of the spinal cord. Inferior to the level of the disc a linear 0.9 cm focal area of cord signal increase is noted along the anterior cord. Severe left foraminal narrowing. No right foraminal narrowing.      At C4-5 shallow posterior disc osteophyte complex and mild facet joint arthropathy. Minimal indentation of the ventral cord but with no cord signal alteration. Moderate bilateral foraminal narrowing.      At C5-6 there is a posterior disc osteophyte complex with a focal left paracentral prominence. Right facet joint arthropathy. Mild mild bilateral foraminal narrowing.      At C6-7 there is a generalized posterior disc osteophyte complex focally indenting the ventral thecal sac and spinal cord. No cord signal alteration. Mild facet joint arthropathy. Severe bilateral foraminal narrowing.      At C7-T1, although no dedicated axial images were acquired there is mild anterolisthesis with evidence of at least moderate bilateral foraminal narrowing.      No significant narrowing of the visualized upper thoracic segments.      Within the subcutaneous tissues overlying the parasagittal left aspect of the lower cervical spine there is a noncomplex appearing encapsulated lesion measuring 4.6 cm x 1.4 cm x 3.3 cm. This demonstrates hyperintense T1 and T2 signal characteristics and likely represents a nonaggressive lipomatous lesion. Otherwise unremarkable visualized paravertebral musculature.      SUMMARY:   Multilevel degenerative changes along the cervical spine. At C3-4 there is mild spinal canal stenosis and focal impingement of the cord with a small focal area of cord signal alteration suspicious for compressive myelomalacia.      Elsewhere no spinal canal compromise. Multilevel moderate and severe neural foraminal narrowing as discussed."

There is mild dextroconvex lumbar curvature.  Vertebral body heights are maintained.  Minimal retrolisthesis of L1 on L2 by 0.3 cm is similar to previous.  No further malalignment is seen.  There is disc desiccation throughout the lower thoracic and lumbar spine with disc space narrowing from L2 to S1 and vacuum phenomenon at a few levels.  There is endplate spurring/osteophytosis at most levels in the lower thoracic and lumbar spine most pronounced on the left at L2-L3 with endplate irregularity and Modic changes greatest from L2 to S1.  A degree of interspinous impingement is present in the lower lumbar spine.  There is a developmentally narrow lumbar spinal canal due to short pedicles.  The conus medullaris is normally positioned at the L1 level.  There is a small central disc protrusion which focally indents the ventral aspect of the thecal sac at T11-T12 and a small right foraminal disc protrusion at T12-L1.  There   are known partially imaged right renal cortical cysts and degenerative change of the partially imaged superior SI joints.  †  At L1-L2: Annular disc bulging and small disc osteophyte complex which flatten the ventral aspect of the thecal sac.  Schmorl's node in the inferior endplate of L1.  Mild left neural foraminal narrowing.  No significant canal, lateral recess or right neural foraminal narrowing.  At L2-L3: Diffuse disc bulge and disc osteophyte complex asymmetrically larger on the left which indent the ventral aspect of the thecal sac.  Together with mild facet and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy, this results in moderate left and mild right neural foraminal narrowing.  No significant canal or lateral recess narrowing.  At L3-L4: Diffuse disc bulge and disc osteophyte complex asymmetrically larger on the left with superimposed small left paracentral disc protrusion which indent the ventral aspect of the thecal sac.  Together with ligamentum flavum thickening and mild to moderate facet degenerative change, this results in mild right and mild to moderate left neural foraminal narrowing and slight narrowing of the left lateral recess.  No significant canal or right lateral recess narrowing.  At L4-L5: Diffuse disc bulge and disc osteophyte complex with superimposed small right paracentral disc protrusion which indent the ventral aspect of the thecal sac.  Together with ligamentum flavum thickening and moderate to advanced facet degenerative change, this results in severe canal narrowing with effacement of the periradicular CSF, central crowding of the cauda equina nerve roots and reduced AP diameter of the thecal sac which measures 0.5 to 0.6 cm.  There is moderate narrowing of the right lateral recess with the transiting right L5 nerve root interposed between the facet and disc material and moderate left and mild-to-moderate right neural foraminal narrowing.  No significant left lateral recess narrowing.  At L5-S1: Diffuse disc bulge and disc osteophyte complex with superimposed tiny left paracentral disc protrusion which flatten the ventral aspect of the thecal sac.  Together with moderate to advanced facet degenerative change, this results in moderate to severe bilateral neural foraminal narrowing with possible compression of the exiting L5 nerve roots as well as slight narrowing of the right lateral recess.  No significant canal or left lateral recess narrowing.  †  IMPRESSION: Progression of multilevel degenerative disc disease, endplate degenerative change, facet arthropathy and ligamentum flavum thickening.  The most salient abnormality is the presence of severe multifactorial canal stenosis at L4-L5.  There is also neural foraminal narrowing of varying degrees at several levels as outlined above most pronounced at L5-S1 where there is possible compromise of the exiting L5 nerve roots along with slight narrowing of the left lateral recess at L3-L4, slight narrowing of the right lateral recess at L5-S1 and moderate narrowing of the right lateral recess at L4-L5 with possible irritation or impingement upon the transiting right L5 nerve root.  Other findings as outlined above."

Only mild facet degeneration is noted.  There is moderate foraminal narrowing bilaterally with near complete effacement of perineural fat within the foramen.  No definite nerve root compression.  Ç†  IMPRESSION: There is degenerative lumbar spondylosis with most notable involvement of the L4-S1 levels.  There is resulting foraminal as well as lateral recess spinal canal narrowing.  This may result in some nerve root irritation and mild impingement, most likely affecting L5 nerve roots.  No definite nerve root compression is seen.  Additional mild degenerative disc disease is noted at L1-2 and L2-3."

Ç C2 / 3: A small posterior midline disc protrusion is associated with focal irregularity of the posterior corner of the C3 superior endplate. This indents the dural tube but does not significantly compress the spinal cord and is not completely humanise the CSF space. Neuroforamina are normal. Ç Thales_Alenia_Space_Spacebus / 4: Normal Ç C4 / Sats_Suns: Normal Ç C5 / 6: Redbird_Arena Ç C6 / 7: A large left parasagittal disc protuberance completely effaces the left anterolateral aspect of the spinal canal with posterior and right - sided displacement of the dural tube and spinal cord. The C7 nerve root is compressed. There is minor narrowing of however neuroforamen but the predominant effect is in the left side of the clavicle_fracture canal. Minimal narrowing is present in the right neuroforamen. Spinal cord is normal in signal intensity. Ç C7 / T1: No significant abnormality is present at this level. There is subtle prominence of the anterior epidural space that relates to the displacement of the dura caused by the protrusion at the level above. The neuroforamina be normal. Ç T1 / T2: Normal. Ç OPINION Ç Large left parasagittal disc protrusion at C6 / 7 with displacement of the dural tube and spinal cord and compression of the left C7 nerve root. Ç Small posterior midline disc protrusion at C2 / 3 descenders the dural tube but is not rapidly affecting neurological structures.

Ç Radiographs of the lumbar spine performed 17 August, 2020 and 13 June, 2016 are available for comparison. Ç A clinical history of "" chronic back pain since motor vehicle accident in 1993 "" has been provided. Ç TECHNICAL: Ç Sagittal and axial T1 - and T2 - weighted sequences were performed. Ç FINDINGS: Ç Transitional anatomy is present at the level of the lumbosacral junction. Visit the purposes of this report (as well as to remain consistent with the recent radiograph reports ), the inferiormost fully - formed disc will be labeled the L5 / S1 level. Note is made of an underdeveloped disc at the S1 / 2 level as well as an anterolisthesis of the body of L3 with respect to the body of L4. A mild curvature is present convex to the left. The vertebral body heights are well - maintained and appear unchanged in the interval. The bone marrow signal is fairly homogeneous allowing for degenerative endplate changes at several levels, most notably at the L4 / 5 level and at the L3 / 4 level. The conus medullaris terminates normally at approximately the level of the T12 / L1 intervertebral disk. The a small insubstantial perineural cyst is noted within the sacral spinal canal at the S2 level. Ç At the S1 / 2 level, an underdeveloped disc is noted. No significant neural foraminal compromise or compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated. Ç At the L5 / S1 level, the intervertebral disc is unremarkable. A pseudoarthrosis with associated degenerative change is present involving the transverse process of L5 with the sacrum on the left side. Mild degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints. No significant neural foraminal compromise or compromise of perhaps adjacent thecal sac is appreciated. Ç At the L4 / 5 level, a small anterior osteophyte is noted straddling the midline, more prominent to the left of midline. Degenerative endplate changes are present, more prominent eccentric to the left. Narrowing of the intervertebral disc is present, advanced on the left and mild to moderate on the right. A small amount of vacuum phenomenon is present within the intervertebral disc eccentric to the left. Disc / osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline which extends laterally protruding into the inferior aspect of the amygdala foramen bilaterally, more prominent on the left side. The posterior disc / osteophyte complex does not appear to involve the traversing L5 nerve roots. Degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints, moderate on the left and mild on the right. There is borderline hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum. The findings are resulting in moderate compromise of the left neural foramen and minimal / mild compromise of the right neural foramen. No significant compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated. Ç At the L3 / 4 level, moderate - to - advanced degenerative endplate changes are present along with marked narrowing of the intervertebral disc. Vacuum phenomenon is present within the intervertebral disc. A defect is present within the pars interarticularis bilaterally at the L3 level with an associated anterolisthesis of certainly body of L3 with respect to the body of L4 measuring approximately 8 mm resulting in uncovering of the posterior aspect of the intervertebral disc. Disc / osteophyte complex is present laterally protruding into the region of the neural foramen bilaterally. Mild degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints. The findings are resulting in severe compromise of the right neural foramen and moderate - to - severe compromise of the left neural foramen. No significant compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated. Ç The remainder of the visualized levels is unremarkable allowing for minor degenerative disc and facet joint changes. Ç Atheromatous irregularity is present involving the abdominal aorta extending into the iliac arteries bilaterally. To the extent visualized, regional soft tissue structures are otherwise unremarkable. Ç IMPRESSION: Ç Transitional anatomy is present at the level of the lumbosacral junction, as stated above. Radiographic correlation is recommended in an effort to ensure accurate localization, especially prior to any interventional procedure. Ç Degenerative change is present involving the intervertebral disc and the facet joints at multiple levels resulting in neural foraminal compromise at several levels, most striking bilaterally at the L3 / 4 level as well as on the left side at the L4 / 5 level, as Visit_www.universalenergycorp.info above. Bilateral spondylolysis is present at the L3 standards resulting in a grade 2 anterolisthesis of the body of L3 with respect to the body of L4 and associated bilateral neural foraminal compromise, as discussed. The degree of anterolisthesis at the L3 / 4 level appears relatively unchanged when compared with the radiographs performed 17 August, 2020. Ç"

292,1,"TECHNIQUE:  Routine lumbar spine sequences with axial T1/T2 sequences from L3-S1 and a further  axial T2 sequence from T12-L3.  CORRELATION:  Comparison is made with the x-rays dated June 15, 2020, and with the MRI dated  August 20, 2017.  FINDINGS:  The lowest complete lumbar disc space is defined as L5-S1 for the purposes of this  report.  There is a slight straightening of the natural lumbar lordosis potentially due to an  element of muscle spasm. Lumbar vertebral height and alignment are otherwise  preserved. No fractures. No spondylolisthesis. There is degenerative disc disease at  L4-5 as detailed below. The remaining lumbar discs are reasonably well preserved,  although there are some prominent anterior endplate osteophytes at L3-4 and smaller  endplate osteophytes at the other lumbar levels.  The conus medullaris lies at L1.  DISCS:  T12-L1 - Minor broad-based posterior disc bulge. No spinal canal or neural foraminal  stenosis.  L1-2 - Normal disc. No spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis.  L2-3 - Normal disc. No spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis.  L3-4 - Normal disc. No spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis. Prominent anterior endplate osteophytes on the left side.  L4-5 - Disc desiccation with mild loss of disc height and a small posterior annular tear.  There is a small broad-based posterior disc bulge. There are severe bilateral facet joint  degenerative changes. There is a 6 mm ovoid lesion at the medial aspect of the right  L4-5 facet joint extending into the lateral recess, likely representing a synovial cyst,  although there is no significant fluid signal. There are congenitally shortened pedicles.  The combination of these findings is resulting in severe spinal stenosis with some  effacement of the posterior epidural fat. There is mild buckling of the cauda equina  proximal to this. There is severe bilateral lateral recess stenosis with impingement on  the descending L5 nerve roots bilaterally. There is mild right neural foraminal  narrowing without exiting nerve root impingement.  L5-S1 - Normal disc. No spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis. Mild bilateral facet  joint degenerative changes.  Other: There is a large exophytic cyst arising from the lower pole of the left kidney,  measuring approximately 7.2 cm in diameter. Probable small exophytic cyst in the  interpolar region of the right kidney.  OPINION:  1. Severe spinal stenosis at L4-5 secondary to a small broad-based posterior  disc bulge, severe facet joint arthropathy and a new 6 mm right L4-5 facet joint  synovial cyst extending into the right lateral recess. The appearances represent a deterioration from the previous MRI.  2. Mild degenerative changes elsewhere within the lumbar spine, but no further  evidence of significant disc bulges, spinal stenosis or neural foraminal stenosis.  3. Large exophytic cyst arising from the lower pole of the left kidney"

310,0,"Reason for Exam: SHE HAS SPINAL STENOSIS AND RADICULOPATHY. SHE IS KNOWN WITH CP. SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO GO FOR BACK SURGERY IN 2017. BUT SHE GOT SICK. ?SPINAL STENOSIS      HISTORY:  As above.     TECHNIQUE:  Standard radiculopathy protocol, consisting of sagittal T1 and T2 imaging from T9 to the upper sacrum and axial T1 and T2 imaging from L3-4 to L5-S1.     FINDINGS:  Comparison made to the MR lumbar spine from April 26, 2016 (Grey Nuns Hospital). Lumbar spine x-rays performed December 5, 2016 (St. Paul HCC) and CT abdomen/pelvis from August 27, 2018 (Cold Lake HCC) were also reviewed.     Five lumbar vertebrae are assumed. Moderate curvature of the lumbar spine convex right centered at L3-4. Vertebral body heights are maintained. No focal destructive osseous lesions.     The lower thoracic spinal cord and conus medullaris are suboptimally assessed due to motion artifact. They appear grossly normal in caliber. Conus terminates in a normal fashion at the L1 level. No fatty filum terminale.     Hypointense T2 signal noted within most of the lower thoracic and lumbar discs, indicative of underlying disc degeneration.     Similar tiny posterior disc protrusions are present at the T9-10, T10-11 and T11-12 levels, indenting the thecal sac but not affecting the spinal cord or nerve roots. No spinal stenosis or significant neural foraminal narrowing at these levels.     At T12-L1, disc height is preserved. Mild annular disc bulging is present. No nerve root impingement, spinal stenosis or neural foraminal stenosis. Minor facet degenerative changes.     At L1-2, there is similar subtle retrolisthesis of L1 on L2. Mild loss of disc height eccentrically towards the right. A small right paracentral disc-osteophyte complex indents the thecal sac but does not affect the conus. Moderate stenosis of the right neural foramen noted. No stenosis of the left neural foramen. No spinal stenosis. Minor facet degenerative changes. Appearances are not significantly changed.     At L2-3, disc height is reasonably well-maintained. A small broad-based posterior disc-osteophyte complex indents the ventral thecal sac and encroaches upon the inferior aspects of both neural foramina, resulting in bilateral neural foraminal stenoses of mild to moderate severity. Mild to moderate left-sided and minor right-sided facet degenerative changes. Slight narrowing of the left lateral recess. No stenosis of the right lateral recess. No spinal stenosis. Appearances are not significantly changed.     At L3-4, there remains moderate loss of disc height laterally towards the left with associated moderately advanced degenerative endplate changes. Moderate left-sided and mild right-sided facet degenerative changes and mild ligamentum flavum thickening also noted. A small broad-based disc-osteophyte complex indents the ventral thecal sac. Moderate stenosis of the left lateral recess and moderate to severe narrowing of the left neural foramen noted. Minor narrowing of the right neural foramen. Right lateral recess remains normal in caliber. No significant spinal stenosis. Appearances overall are not significantly changed.     At L4-5, disc height is well-maintained. Bilateral moderate to severe facet degenerative changes are present with ligamentum flavum thickening. A small broad-based posterior disc-osteophyte complex indents the ventral thecal sac. A 6 mm circumscribed focus of hyperintense T1 and T2 signal situated along the anteromedial aspect of the right facet joint is unchanged. This corresponds to a either a small focus of ossification or calcified synovial cyst on the CT scan, contributing to moderate to severe right lateral recess stenosis. There is mild transverse narrowing of the thecal sac posteriorly. No significant left lateral recess narrowing. Mild stenoses of both neural foramina. Appearances overall are similar to the prior MR study.     At L5-S1, there is grade 1-2 spondylolisthesis of 6 mm, worse compared to the 2016 study. Disc height is reasonably well-maintained. There is unroofing of the posterior disc margin, with a small shallow disc bulge indenting the ventral thecal sac. There is severe degeneration of the left facet joint, with severe joint space narrowing and adjacent sclerosis and bony overgrowth evident. Moderate degeneration of the right facet joint also noted. Unilateral right-sided spondylolysis of L5 is again evident. Combination of these findings results in bilateral lateral recess stenoses of at least moderate severity and moderate spinal stenosis. There is severe stenosis of the right neural foramen with virtually complete effacement of the perineural fat and compression and flattening of the exiting right L5 nerve root. Moderate to severe stenosis of the left neural foramen also noted.     Mild degenerative changes noted within the visualized sacroiliac joints. Prevertebral soft tissues are unremarkable.     OPINION:  1. Spondylolisthesis of L5 on S1 is slightly worse compared to the 2016 MR examination. Anterolisthesis is secondary to a combination of right L5 spondylolysis and bilateral facet degeneration. Facet degeneration is severe on the left side. There is severe stenosis of the right L5-S1 neural foramen with compression of the exiting right L5 nerve root. Moderate to severe stenosis of the left neural foramen, bilateral lateral recess stenoses of moderate severity and moderate spinal stenosis at this level also.     2. Multilevel degenerative disc disease in the remainder of the spine is of similar severity, as detailed above. Moderate to severe stenosis of the right lateral recess at L4-5 secondary to a combination of disc degeneration, facet degeneration and small focus of ossification (or synovial cyst with peripheral calcification) at the anteromedial aspect of the right facet joint. Spinal stenosis of moderate severity at L4-5 also."

375,1,"Findings: Ç Direct comparison is made with the prior lumbar MRI of 2017. Ç Identification of current L5 segment is defined by the location of the iliolumbar ligament. Ç A normal conus medullaris terminates at L1. Ç Multilevel spondylosis and moderate - to - severe degenerative disc disease arenot again seen. This has progressed in some levels. Ç Degenerative fracture marrow signal change is evident in multiple levels. No other significant abnormality of bone marrow signal is seen. Ç Central canal is reduced in two levels as discussed below. Ç In T11 - 12, a chronic broad posterior disc - osteophyte complex results in mild central stenosis with some distortion of cord and thecal sac contour. This may be the etiology of the thoracic myelopathy described on the history for the 2017 MRI request. However, cord signal remains normal, showing whatsoever edema or evidence for myelomalacia. The mild stenosis appears relatively stable. Ç In T12 - L1 and in L1 - 2, minor broad posterior disc bulges are stable, causing no neural compromise. The facet joints show minor degenerative change without definite osteoarthritis. Ç In L2 - 3, severe disc degeneration has nearly obliterated the intervertebral disc, representing a significant adverse change from 2017 when the disc was near normal. There is minor retrolisthesis. A broad posterior disc bulge associated with the disc degeneration is slightly eccentric towards the right side. There is now mild central stenosis, with slight distortion in the thecal sac contour. However, no convincing facet_joints root compromise is seen, as perineural fat is still preserved bilaterally with respect to exiting and descending nerves. Mild / moderate osteoarthritis of the bilateral facet joints is present. É_¢_Ç Previously seen fluid between spinous processes of L2 and L3 has resolved, leaving advanced degenerative change. Ç L3 - 4 remains stable. A broad posterior disc bulge slightly indents the ventral thecal sac but does not prolonged_immobilization any convincing neural compromise. Previously suggested mild central stenosis shows no adverse change. Moderately severe bilateral facet OA is evident. Ç L4 - 5 is stable. The broad posterior remastered_reissue bulge indents the ventral thecal sac but does not cause convincing neural compromise. The previously described mild bilateral foraminal stenosis shows no progression. Perineural fat is still preserved. Severe bilateral facet OA is again evident, with minimal degenerative grade 1 anterolisthesis which was previously present. Ç L5 - S1 is stable. The minimal broad posterior disc bulge barely touches the thecal sac because of the capacious size of the central canal in this level. Neural elements remain fully intact with no compromise. Severe bilateral facet OA is again seen. Ç Impression: Ç Multilevel degenerative disc disease and spondylosis are again seen. The only adverse change from 2017 is the development of new severe degenerative disc disease in dpad - 3 which was previously near normal. Ç The above produces a new level of mild central stenosis. Ç Prior mild central stenosis in T11 - T12 remains stable; while there may still be mild cord compression, the cord does not show any edema or evidence of myelomalacia. Clinical correlation is required regarding any persistence of the thoracic myelopathy clinically described in 2017. Ç Again no other potential neural compromise is seen on this study, and there is no specific site of convincing nerve root compromise. Ç Moderate to severe facet OA is overviewing in most levels."

Findings: Compared to plain films dated October 28, 2020. Tthe visualized posterior fossa demonstrates an unremarkable appearance, with normally positioned cerebellar tonsils. The visualized spinal cord underscore a normal appearance with no altered signal or evidence of syrinx. There is 3 mm of anterior subluxation of C3 upon C4. Alignment of the cervical spine is otherwise impressive. Vertebral body marrow signal is diffusely heterogeneous, with advanced degenerative endplate changes at the C3 - 4 level as well as the C6 - 7 level. C2 - 3: Mild disc osteophyte complex causing flattening of anterior thecal sac. Neuroforamen remain patent bilaterally. C3 - 4: Broad - based disc osteophyte complex resulting in moderate spinal canal stenosis with some associated mass effect upon the spinal cord. There is also some subtle increased T2 signal intensity noted within sported_Steeler right posterior aspect of the spinal cord concerning for edema / myelomalacia. Bilateral uncovertebral joint osteophytes result in mild bilateral foraminal stenosis, right greater than left. Crippling disc space narrowing. Bilateral facet joint arthropathy. C4 - 5: Broad - based disc osteophyte complex resulting in mild spinal canal stenosis. Bilateral uncovertebral joint osteophytes result in suspected mild bilateral foraminal stenosis. The left - sided neural foramen is suboptimally assessed due to metallic artifact due to a foreign body within the left - sided paraspinal soft tissues. This was appreciated on the plain Bullet_Ek_Dhamaka of October 28, 2020. Mild disc space narrowing. C5 - 6: Broad - based disc osteophyte complex resulting in moderate spinal canal stenosis. Bilateral uncovertebral joint osteophytes result in moderate right - sided and mild left - sided foraminal stenosis. Moderate disc space narrowing. C6 - 7: Broad - based disc osteophyte complex resulting in mild spinal canal stenosis. Bilateral uncovertebral joint osteophytes result in mild bilateral foraminal pulmonary_vein. Mild disc space narrowing. The imaged upper thoracic cartilages demonstrates additional broad - based disc osteophyte complexes at every level resulting in some mild spinal canal stenosis. Associated foraminal stenosis is noted particularly on the right hand side of a moderate degree at the T1 - 2 level. Impression: Multilevel degenerative changes as described, with moderate right - sided foraminal stenosis noted at the C5 - 6 level, which may result in irritation of the stumbling right C6 nerve root. Additionally, there is subtle increased T2 signal intensity within the right aspect of entire spinal cord centered at the C3 - 4 level suggestive of edema / myelomalacia. There is moderate canal stenosis at this level which does result in some mild mass effect upon the spinal cord although no significant spinal cord compression was noted at this time."

391,0,"MRI LUMBAR SPINE  Technique:  Multiplanar multisequence MRI of the lumbosacral spine was performed.  FINDINGS:  The conus medullaris terminates at the L1-2. It is normal. The L1-2 disc space is  normal. The thecal sac, spinal canal and neural foramina are also normal at this level.  A mild degenerative disc bulge is seen at the L2-3 but the thecal sac, spinal canal and  neural foramina are normal.  At L3-4, a moderate degree generalized at degenerative disc bulge is seen. This is  associated with a mild to moderate degree reduction in the height of the disc space and  anterior marginal osteophyte formation. The thecal sac, spinal canal and neural  foramina are normal.  The L4-5 disc is normal. The thecal sac, spinal canal and neural foramina are normal.  There is a mild hypertrophic degenerative osteoarthritic is of bilateral facet joints at this  level.  At L5-S1, at least a moderate degree degenerative disc bulge is seen. Height of the  disc is space is slightly reduced and there is a posterior marginal osteophyte formation  on the left side which is causing narrowing of the inferior portion of the left L5-S1 neural  foramen. I suspect a mild compression of the left L5 nerve root outside the foramen  because of the marginal osteophyte. The right neural foramen and exiting right L5  nerve root are normal. Descending bilateral S1 nerve roots are normal in the lateral  recesses. Facet joints are normal.  OPINION: A moderate degree degenerative disc disease at L3-4 and L5-S1. The disc-osteophyte  formation is more pronounced in the left lateral aspect at the L5-S1 where the left L5  nerve root may be slightly impinged just outside the foramen, if any. Degenerative  osteoarthritis of the L4-5 facet joints is seen.  The Workers' Compensation Board has requested that we provide a professional  opinion as to whether the imaging findings are related whole or in part to the injury in  question. This is not considered part of the official diagnostic imaging report, and will  only be used to help a WCB caseworker decide whether the injury is work-related or  not. My opinion is:  Some of the imaging findings could be related to the patient's injury."

Mild degenerative change is present involving the predental space. The cerebellar tonsils appear normal with respect to position. At the C2 / 3 level, subtle degenerative endplate changes are present. Minor degenerative changes are present involving the uncovertebral and facet joints bilaterally. The neural foramina appear patent. At the C3 / 4 low, subtle degenerative endplate changes are present. Minor disc / osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the terminal_ileum, which narrows the ventral subarachnoid space. Mild degenerative changes are present involving the uncovertebral and facet joints bilaterally, more prominent on the right side. The findings are resulting in at least mild compromise of the right neural femoral_head. The left neural foramen is patent. At the C4 / 5 level, subtle degenerative endplate changes are present. Minor disc / osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline, which appears to upzone but not significantly compress the ventral surface of the adjacent spinal cord. Mild degenerative changes are present involving the uncovertebral and facet joints bilaterally, more prominent back the right side. The findings are resulting in at least mild compromise of the right neural foramen. The left neural foramen is patent. At the C5 / 6 level, mild degenerative endplate changes are present. Mild disc / osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline along with a superimposed minuscule disc protrusion posteriorly in the midline, all of which appear to abut but not significantly compress the ventral surface of the adjacent spinal cord. Minor degenerative changes are present involving the uncovertebral and facet joints bilaterally. The neural foramina appear patent. At the C6 / 7 level, degenerative endplate changes are present along by mild - to - moderate narrowing of the intervertebral disc. Disc / osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline along with a superimposed tiny disc protrusion posteriorly in the midline and hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum, all of which abut and result in at least mild compression of the adjacent thecal sac / spinal cord. Additionally, focal abnormal increased T2 signal is present within the adjacent spinal cord, compatible with edematous change. Degenerative changes are present involving the uncovertebral and facet joints bilaterally, more prominent on the right side. The findings are resulting in severe compromise of the right neural foramen and at least mild compromise of the left neural foramen. At the C7 / T1 level, subtle degenerative endplate changes are present. Minor degenerative changes are present involving the facet rotator_cuff_muscles. The neural foramina appear patent. At the T1 / 2 HGNSI, subtle degenerative endplate changes and narrowing of the intervertebral Discs is present. A minuscule disc protrusion is present posteriorly immediately to the right of midline which narrows the ventral subarachnoid space. Mild degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints. The neural foramina appear patent. The remainder of the visualized levels are unremarkable allowing for relatively mild degenerative disc and facet joint changes. To the extent visualized, the regional soft tissue structures are unremarkable. IMPRESSION Multilevel spondylosis resulting in neural foraminal compromise at several levels as detailed above. Disc / osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline at the C6 / 7 level along with a superimposed tiny disc protrusion in the midline which along with hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum results in at least mild compression of the adjacent thecal sac / spinal cord along with focal spinal cord edema.

Findings: Lumbar spine radii is normal. Vertebral body heights are maintained. The conus medullaris and cauda equina are normal. At the T12 - L1 level the disc is normal. The thecal sac and exiting nerve roots are complimentary of compression. At the L1 - 2 level there is a small left paracentral disc protrusion Thirdly minimally compresses the anterior aspect of the thecal sac on the left. The exiting and Hormuz_Straits nerve roots are free of compression. At the L2 - 3 level there is some circumferential disc bulging causing minimal compression on the anterior aspect of By_Christine_Fenno thecal sac. The exiting and transiting nerve roots are free of compression. At the L3 - 4 level there is circumferential disc bulging with a small right paracentral disc protrusion. There is minimal compression on the anterior aspect of the thecal sac and some mild lateral recess stenosis is seen. Theres is some mild foraminal encroachment bilaterally but no definite exiting nerve root or transiting nerve root compressions are seen. At the L4 - 5 level there is circumferential disc bulging with a small to moderate posterior midline disc protrusion with moderate severe facet joint osteoarthritis bilaterally. This causes mild central canal stenosis and moderate severe lateral recess stenosis bilaterally. The exiting nerve roots are free of compression. There is severe transiting nerve root compression bilaterally. At the L5 - S1 level there is circumferential disc bulging. There is a 14 x 9 x 12 mm mass identified in the left lateral recess at the level of the L5 vertebral body likely representating extruded disc material however a neurofibroma or other neoplastic lesion would be in the differential diagnosis. This causes moderate compression of the left anterolateral aspect of the thecal sac. It appears to Poorly_formated_references causing severe compression of the exiting left L5 nerve root as it enters the foramina. Transiting nerve roots remain free of compression. The exiting right nerves root is free of compression. There is severe facet joint osteoarthritis noted bilaterally.

The conus terminates  at the T12-L1 level and is of normal contour, caliber and signal. Visualized paraspinal  soft tissues are unremarkable to the extent visualized. There is an underlying  congenital stenosis of the lumbar spine extending from approximately the L2 vertebral  body through to L4 with shortened pedicular distances. Level by level information as  follows:  As visualized in the sagittal plane at T11-12 and T12-L1, there is mild degenerative disc  disease present at the disc levels, in particular at T12-L1 without evidence for spinal  canal or foraminal stenosis.  At L1-2, there is moderate degenerative disc disease with narrowing of the  intervertebral disc space and diffuse loss of intranuclear T2 signal with circumferential  disc bulge, which indents the ventral thecal sac resulting in mild-to-moderate spinal  canal stenosis and crowding of the cauda equina nerve roots. Disc and osteophyte  extending into the foramina, left greater than right, without visible impingement or  compression on the exiting L2 nerves. Facet joints exhibit minor degenerative  changes.  At L2-3, moderate severe degenerative disc disease with areas of vacuum  phenomenon seen anteriorly and endplate remodeling. Circumferential disc bulge with  background congenital stenosis result in moderate severe spinal canal stenosis and  significant crowding of the cauda equina nerve roots such that there is no visible surrounding CSF. There is prominent epidural fat at this level. Disc and endplate  osteophytes extend in the foramina, right greater than left. There is possible contact by  disc and endplate osteophyte along the foraminal portion of the right L3 nerve (axial  image 14), which has the potential for contact and irritation. No evidence for left  foraminal stenosis. The facet joints are relatively well maintained apart from minor  early degenerative change.  At L3-4, moderate severe degenerative disc disease with diffuse circumferential disc  bulge and underlying congenital stenosis of the lumbar spine. Moderate severe spinal  canal stenosis with significant crowding of the cauda equina nerve roots and prominent  epidural fat. There is a superimposed small central disc protrusion. Disc and endplate  osteophyte extend into the foramina, but the perineural fat surrounding the foraminal  portions of the L3 nerves is relatively well maintained. There is minor degenerative  change of the facet joints and minor ligamentum flavum hypertrophy but not  significantly contributing to spinal canal stenosis.  At L4-5, severe degenerative disc disease with mixed type I and type II Modic endplate  changes. There is moderate severe spinal canal stenosis at this level with  circumferential disc bulge and significant crowding of the cauda equina nerve roots and  prominent epidural fat at this level. There is severe left foraminal stenosis with  compression and impingement of the foraminal left L4 nerve. There is moderate right  foraminal stenosis with potential contact and irritation on the foraminal portion of the  right L4 nerve. There is moderate right and mild left facet arthropathy with ligamentum  flavum hypertrophy with facet joint tropism, which does not result in significant spinal  canal stenosis.  At L5-S1, signal from the intervertebral disc is relatively well maintained. There is no  evidence for significant spinal canal or foraminal stenosis. Mild left facet arthropathy is  present.

The visualized spinal cord demonstrates a normal appearance with no altered signal or evidence of syrinx. There is 4 to 5 mm of posterior subluxation of C5 upon C6. There is also straightening of the cervical spine with loss of the normal lordosis. Vertebral body marrow signal is unremarkable, other than degenerative endplate changes, most pronounced at the C5-6 level.  †  C2-3: Broad-based disc osteophyte complex eccentric to the right causing flattening of anterior thecal sac and some mild narrowing of the right-sided neural foramen.  †  C3-4: Mild broad-based disc osteophyte complex flattens the anterior thecal sac. Bilateral uncovertebral joint osteophytes and facet joint hypertrophy contribute to mild narrowing of the left-sided neural foramen.  †  C4-5: Broad-based disc osteophyte complex resulting in moderate spinal canal stenosis with some associated mass effect upon the spinal cord. No underlying spinal cord signal change. Bilateral uncovertebral joint osteophytes and facet joint arthropathy contribute to moderate bilateral foraminal stenosis left greater than right. Mild disc space narrowing.  †  C5-6: Broad-based disc osteophyte complex resulting in moderate to severe spinal canal stenosis with effacement of CSF around the spinal cord and associated flattening of the spinal cord. Bilateral uncovertebral joint osteophytes result in severe narrowing of both neuroforamen, left greater than right.

Bilateral uncovertebral joint osteophytes result in at least moderate bilateral foraminal stenosis. Moderate disc space narrowing.  †  The imaged upper thoracic spine demonstrates additional broad-based disc osteophyte complex causing mild flattening of anterior thecal sac with no significant canal stenosis or neural foraminal stenosis bilaterally.  †  Impression:  †  Multilevel degenerative changes as described, most pronounced at C5-6 with moderate to severe spinal canal stenosis with associated underlying spinal cord compression. No underlying spinal cord signal change appreciated. Additionally, severe bilateral foraminal stenosis left greater than right is noted likely contributing to exiting C6 nerve root irritation/compression bilaterally.  †  Allowing for variances in imaging technique and slice selection, no significant interval change noted.

FOR DISC HERNIATION FORAMINAL STENOSIS AND NERVE IMPINGEMENT COMPARISON: MRI lumbar spine October 27, 2018 TECHNIQUE: Sagittal axial T1 and T2 the reclining_rear spine FINDINGS: 5 lumbar type vertebra are assumed for the purposes of this report with normal termination of conus medullaris at L1. Alignment and vertebral body heights are within normal limits. Modic type I degenerative signal change is seen within the L2 - L4 vertebra, with disc degeneration at countless levels, similar to slightly increased from 2018. Allowing for presence of this edema no suspicious organs replacing lesions are seen. At T11 - 12 and T12 - L1: Small disc protrusions are seen, with no significant spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis. At L1 - 2: Broad disc bulge results in mild narrowing of the spinal canal, unchanged with no evidence of nerve root impingement. Neural foramina are patent. At dpad - 3: Small broad disc bulge in combination with hypertrophic facet arthropathy results in mild to moderate narrowing of the spinal canal, unchanged. Moderate right and mild left neural foraminal narrowing secondary to facet and endplate osteophyte has slightly increased. At L3 - 4: Small broad disc bulge in combination with hypertrophic facet arthropathy results in mild narrowing of the spinal canal, possibly slightly from October 2018. Severe left neural foraminal narrowing secondary to facet arthropathy and possible foraminal extent of disc appears unchanged. Right neural foramen is patent. At L4 - 5: Small broad disc bulge and mild facet arthropathy. Mild spinal canal narrowing with no evidence of nerve root impingement within the spinal canal. Moderate to severe right and moderate left neural foraminal narrowing secondary to facet arthropathy, possibly some component of endplate osteophyte and disc on the right, similar to previous. At L5 - S1: No significant spinal canal stenosis. Mild left neural foraminal narrowing secondary to facet arthropathy. Limited assessment of the paraspinal soft tissues demonstrates no other significant abnormalities. IMPRESSION: 1. Multilevel degenerative change in the lumbar spine as described above. Mild spinal canal narrowing at L3 - 4 may have slightly increased. Otherwise no new spinal stenosis. 2. Severe left neural foraminal narrowing at L3 - 4 and moderate to severe right neural foraminal narrowing at L4 - 5 is better seen on the current study so allowing for technical factors appears similar. This could be compromising the left L3 and right L4 nerve roots respectively."
528,0,Technique: Routine cervical spine protocol is performed along with additional transverse T2-weighted spin-echo sequences.     Findings: Cervical spine alignment is normal. Vertebral body heights and bone marrow signals are normal. Cord signal and morphology is within normal limits.     At the C2-3 level there is some posterior disc bulging but the cord and exiting nerve roots are free of compression.     At the C3-4 level there is some mild posterior disc bulging but the cord and exiting nerve roots are free of compression.     At the C4-5 level there is some posterior disc bulging which narrows the anterior aspect of the thecal sac but the cord and exiting nerve roots are free of compression.     At C5-6 level there is posterior disc bulging with vertebral endplate osteophytic lipping which touches and possibly minimally compresses the cord. There is severe foraminal encroachment bilaterally with bilateral exiting nerve root compressions.     At the C6-7 level there is a small to moderate left paracentral disc protrusion causing minimal compression of the cord on the left. There is moderate severe foraminal encroachment on the left with exiting nerve root compression and moderate foraminal encroachment on the right also with some exiting nerve root compression.

547,1,Reason for Exam: LEFT SIDED SCIATICA WITH PAIN DOWN TO TOES. SOME BOWEL DYSFUNCTION AS WELL. QUERY NERVE ROOT IMPINGEMENT. Technique: Routine lumbar spine protocol is performed. Findings: Lumbar spine alignment is normal. Vertebral body heights are maintained. The conus medullaris and cauda equina are normal. At the T12 - L1 level the disc is normal. The thecal sac and exiting nerve roots are free of compression. At the L1 - 2 level there is a small left paracentral disc ilium which minimally compresses the anterior aspect of the thecal sac until the left. The exiting and transiting nerve roots are free of compression. At the L2 - Avg. level there is some circumferential disc bulging causing minimal compression on the anterior aspect of the thecal sac. The exiting and transiting nerve roots are free of compression. At the L3 - 4 level there is circumferential disc bulging with a small right paracentral disc protrusion. There is minimal compression on the anterior aspect of the thecal sac and some mild lateral recess stenosis is seen. There is some mild foraminal encroachment bilaterally but no definite exiting nerve goosegrass or transiting nerve root compressions are seen. At the L4 - 5 level there is circumferential disc bulging with a small to moderate posterior midline disc protrusion with moderate severe facet joint osteoarthritis demanded_nonaggression_treaty. This causes mild central canal stenosis and moderate severe lateral recess diameter_stenosis bilaterally. The exiting nerve roots are free of compression. There is severe transiting nerve root compression bilaterally. At the L5 - S1 level there is circumferential disc bulging. There is a 14 x 9 x 12 mm mass identified in the returned lateral recess at the level of the L5 vertebral Sybil_Berndt likely representing extruded disc material however a neurofibroma or other neoplastic lesion would be in the differential diagnosis. This causes moderate compression of the left anterolateral aspect of the thecal sac. It appears to be causing severe compression of the exiting left L5 nerve root as it enters the foramina. Transiting nerve roots remain free of compression. The exiting right nerve root is free of compression. Thereare is severe facet joint osteoarthritis noted bilaterally. IMPRESSION: Multilevel degenerative disc changes with facet joint osteoarthritis at several levels. Masslike abnormality in the left lateral recess superior to the L5 - S1 disc space causing severe compression of the exiting left L5 nerve root. This most likely represents extruded disc material however a neoplastic lesion cannot be completely excluded. Further alleged with a contrast - enhanced study could be helpful.

FOR SPONDYLOARTHROPATHY PROTOCOL OF ENTIRE SPINE.  IS THIS ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS?   AND WORSENING RADATION TO THE LEFT LEG.  †  Spondyloarthropathy protocol.  †  Vertebral body heights are maintained.  Increased thoracic kyphosis and lumbar lordosis.  Minor anterolisthesis L3 vertebral body on L4, L4 vertebral body on L5.  Degrees of degenerative signal loss, narrowing, marginal osteophytosis, and/or Modic endplate signal alteration/shallow Schmorl type herniation involving multiple cervical, thoracic, lumbar intervertebral discs.  Disc osteophyte complexes indent the ventral thecal sac 3-7 without cord compression.  Small thoracic disc osteophyte complexes at multiple levels also indents the ventral thecal sac without frank canal stenosis or cord compression.  Degrees of degenerative facet joint overgrowth particularly at lumbar levels.  No focal abnormal inflammatory signal alteration is seen to suggest active spondylitis.  †  The sacroiliac joints are patent showing degenerative cartilage thinning, subchondral sclerosis, marginal osteophytosis; with small patchy areas of reactive subchondral marrow edema at the anterior margins of both joints.  †  There is marginal change overall compared with the prior study of July 30, 2018.  †  Opinion:  †  Marginal if any alteration overall compared with the prior study.  Widespread degenerative changes again present, with small scattered areas of subchondral STIR signal increase in both sacroiliac joints anteriorly felt most likely to be degenerative in nature.  The features do not convincingly suggest active inflammatory spondylitis or sacroiliitis."
583,1,"Findings:  Ç†  Direct comparison is made with the prior lumbar MRI of 2017.  Ç†  Identification of the L5 segment is defined by the location of the iliolumbar ligament.  Ç†  A normal conus medullaris terminates at L1 .  Ç†  Multilevel spondylosis and moderate-to-severe degenerative disc disease are again seen.  This has progressed in some levels.  Ç†  Degenerative bone marrow signal change is evident in multiple levels.  No other significant abnormality of bone marrow signal is seen.  Ç†  Central canal is reduced in two levels as discussed below.  Ç†  In T11-12, a chronic broad posterior disc-osteophyte complex results in mild central stenosis with some distortion of cord and thecal sac contour.  This may be the etiology of the thoracic myelopathy described on the history for the 2017 MRI request.  However, cord signal remains normal, showing no edema or evidence for myelomalacia.  The mild stenosis appears relatively stable.  Ç†  In T12-L1 and in L1-2, minor broad posterior disc bulges are stable, causing no neural compromise.  The facet joints show minor degenerative change without definite osteoarthritis.  Ç†  In L2-3, severe disc degeneration has nearly obliterated the intervertebral disc, representing a significant adverse change from 2017 when the disc was near normal.  There is minor retrolisthesis.  A broad posterior disc bulge associated with the disc degeneration is slightly eccentric towards the right side.  There is now mild central stenosis, with slight distortion in the thecal sac contour.  However, no convincing nerve root compromise is seen, as perineural fat is still preserved bilaterally with respect to exiting and descending nerves.  Mild/moderate osteoarthritis of the bilateral facet joints is present.  Ç†  Previously seen fluid between spinous processes of L2 and L3 has resolved, leaving advanced degenerative change.  Ç†  L3-4 remains stable.  A broad posterior disc bulge slightly indents the ventral thecal sac but does not cause any convincing neural compromise.  Previously suggested mild central stenosis shows no adverse change.  Moderately severe bilateral facet OA is evident.  Ç†  L4-5 is stable.  The broad posterior disc bulge indents the ventral thecal sac but does not cause convincing neural compromise.  The previously described mild bilateral foraminal stenosis shows no progression.  Perineural fat is still preserved.  Severe bilateral facet OA is again evident, with minimal degenerative grade 1 anterolisthesis which was previously present.  Ç†  L5-S1 is stable.  The minimal broad posterior disc bulge barely touches the thecal sac because of the capacious size of the central canal in this level.  Neural elements remain fully intact with no compromise.  Severe bilateral facet OA is again seen.  Ç†  Impression:  Ç†  Multilevel degenerative disc disease and spondylosis are again seen.  The only adverse change from 2017 is the development of new severe degenerative disc disease in L2-3 which was previously near normal.  Ç†  The above produces a new level of mild central stenosis.  Ç†  Prior mild central stenosis in T11-T12 remains stable; while there may still be mild cord compression, the cord does not show any edema or evidence of myelomalacia.  Clinical correlation is required regarding any persistence of the thoracic myelopathy clinically described in 2017.  Ç†  Again no other potential neural compromise is seen on this study, and there is no specific site of convincing nerve root compromise.  Ç†  Moderate to severe facet OA is present in most levels."

628,0,"MRI OF THE LUMBAR SPINE     HISTORY: Falling from leg weakness. ? Nerve impingement.     TECHNIQUE: Transverse and sagittal images were obtained through the lumbar spine and sacrum.     FINDINGS: There appear to be six lumbar-type vertebrae noted with the transitional L6 vertebra.     Vertebral body heights in the lumbar spine are maintained and bone marrow signals are normal.     The mid to upper sacral region is extremely deformed, likely secondary to radiation osteitis.     At the L3-L4 level, the disc is normal. The thecal sac, exiting, and transiting nerve roots are free of compression.     At the L4-L5 level, the disc is normal. The thecal sac, exiting, and transiting nerve roots are free of compression.     At the L5-L6 level, the disc is normal. The thecal sac, exiting, and transiting nerve roots are free of compression. There is severe facet joint osteoarthritis.     At the transition between the L6 vertebra and the sacrum, there is an old deformed disc. There is some mild foraminal encroachment bilaterally with some mild exiting nerve root compression seen.     The body of the sacrum is markedly deformed and shows some expansion and inhomogeneity of the bone. This appears to be causing significant encroachment of the sacral foramina with probable bilateral exiting nerve root compressions at several levels in the mid to upper sacrum. Multiple perineural root sleeve cysts are identified within the spinal canal, the largest on the right measuring 2.4 cm.     No definite pre-sacral soft tissue masses or fluid collections seen.     IMPRESSION:   The lumbar spine is relatively normal with no significant exiting or transiting nerve root compression seen. Again there is significant expansion of the bone of the sacrum likely due to prior radiation osteitis resulting in bilateral mid and upper sacral foraminal encroachments causing exiting nerve root compressions at several levels.

Correlation is made to prior imaging, the most recent radiographs performed on August 28, 2019. FINDINGS: MRI CERVICAL SPINE: There is normal alignment of the vertebral bodies and facet joints with no significant loss in vertebral body height. C2 / 3: No significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing. C3 / 4: No significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing.

MRI THORACIC SPINE: Small benign hemangioma is noted within the T6 vertebral body. Mild anterior wedging of the T8, T9, and T10 vertebral bodies is similar to the prior CT study of January 28, 2019. Multilevel endplate degenerative changes with undulation of the endplates within the mid / lower thoracic spine associated with small Schmorl ' s nodes are also again noted. An exaggeration of the thoracic kyphosis centered at T8 / 9 goes also similar to the prior CT study. There is otherwise normal alignment of the vertebral bodies and facet joints. On the localizer images, prominent T2 hyperintensity within the L5 vertebral body may relate to an underlying hemangioma. Small superior Schmorl ' s nodes are also noted at L5 and S1. Focal ventral distortion of the thoracic spinal cord is noted at the level of T8, abutting the T8 vertebral body. The proximal_tibia aspect of the thoracic spinal cord at the level of T8 has a focally angulated appearance. Abnormal T2 hyperintensity is noted within the thoracic spinal cord at the level of T8 extending to the level of T9. Hypertrophic Retinitis_pigmentosa facet arthropathy is contributing to mild neural foraminal narrowing at T11 / 12. No other significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing throughout the thoracic spine. IMPRESSION: Appearances are compatible with a spinal cord herniation at the level of T8.

Since the prior study, there is been progression of degenerative change at L3-4 now with increased Schmorl type herniation of the superior L4 endplate and mild overall loss of height.  Remaining lumbar vertebral body heights are maintained.  Anterolisthesis of the L3 vertebral body and L4 again evident, though increased during the interval now measuring about 9 mm.  Further degrees of degenerative facet joint overgrowth.  †  L1-2 disc shows mild posterior annular bulging with no focal protrusion.

Uncovering of the annulus with bilateral foraminal components more pronounced on the right.  Increased anterolisthesis.  Severe stenosis of the thecal sac now present, its anteroposterior dimension reduced to about 3 mm in the midline with effacing of CSF and compression of the cauda.  Right L3 neural foramen remain stenotic with marked attenuation of epidural fat adjacent the exiting right L3 nerve root some probable compression of the nerve root.

Bilateral foraminal stenosis, thinned epidural fat planes remaining visible adjacent the exiting L4 nerve roots, more thinned on the left.  Degenerative facet joint overgrowth impinges the posterolateral thecal sac, with some posterior indentation of the posterior thecal sac by the posterior epidural fat.

MRI THORACIC SPINE: Small benign hemangioma is noted within the T6 vertebral body. Mild anterior wedging of the T8, T9, and T10 vertebral bodies is similar to the prior CT study of January 28, 2019. Multilevel endplate degenerative changes with undulation of the endplates within the mid / lower thoracic spine associated with small Schmorl ' s nodes are also again noted. An exaggeration of the thoracic kyphosis centered at T8 / 9 is also similar to the prior CT study. There is otherwise normal alignment of the vertebral bodies and facet joints. On the VOR_DME images, prominent T2 hyperintensity within the L5 vertebral body may relate to an underlying hemangioma. Small superior Schmorl ' s nodes are also noted at L5 and S1. Focal ventral distortion of the thoracic spinal cord is noted at the level of T8, abutting Jeff_Francouer_bounced T8 vertebral body. The posterior aspect of the thoracic spinal cord at the level of T8 has a focally angulated appearance. Abnormal T2 hyperintensity is noted above the thoracic spinal cord at the AJGA_alumni of T8 extending to the highest of T9. Hypertrophic degenerative facet arthropathy is contributing to mild neural foraminal narrowing at T11 / 12. No other significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing throughout the thoracic spine. IMPRESSION: Appearances are compatible with a spinal cord herniation at the level of T8.

Ç At T11 - 12: Small left paracentral disc protrusion mildly narrowing the left lateral / subarticular recess. No evidence of significant impingement upon the conus medullaris. Mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing secondary to facet arthropathy. Ç At T12 - L1: No significant spinal canal narrowing. Mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing secondary to facet Morton_neuroma. Ç At L1 - 2: Small broad HD_DVDR bulge. No evidence of nerve root impingement. Mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing secondary to facet arthropathy. Ç At L2 - 3: Broad disc bulge in combination with ligamentum flavum thickening and hypertrophic facet arthropathy causes mild to moderate narrowing of the spinal canal, most conspicuously the subarticular recesses where disc abuts the traversing L3 nerve roots.

Moderate bilateral neural foraminal narrowing secondary to facet arthropathy has increased from previous. Ç At L4 - 5: Grade ##to anterolisthesis of L4 and L5 associated facet arthropathy is increased from 2016. This is associated with mild unroofing of the disc, but no significant posterior disc bulge. Hypertrophic facet is most prominent on the left where there is marked narrowing of the subarticular recess, likely causing some distortion of the traversing L5 nerve John_Vavricka_Chiron. Moderate left and mild right frontal_parietal foraminal narrowing secondary to facet arthropathy and small amount of foraminal disc. This has increased from 2016.

Alignment and vertebral body heights are within normal limits. Modic type I degenerative signal change is seen within the L2 - L4 vertebra, with disc degeneration at these levels, similar to slightly increased from 2018. Allowing for presence of this edema no suspicious marrow replacing lesions are seen. At T11 - 12 and T12 - L1: Small disc protrusions are discerned, with no significant spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis. At L1 - 2: Broad disc bulge results in mild narrowing of the spinal canal, percentfrom with no evidence of nerve root impingement. Neural foramina are patent. At L2 - 3: Small broad disc bulge in combination with hypertrophic facet arthropathy results in mild to moderate narrowing of the spinal canal, unchanged. Moderate right and mild left neural foraminal narrowing secondary to facet and endplate osteophyte has slightly increased. At L3 - 4: Menkedick broad disc bulge in combination with hypertrophic facet arthropathy ENHANCE_study in mild narrowing of the spinal canal, possibly slightly from October 2018. Severe left neural foraminal narrowing secondary to facet arthropathy and possible foraminal extent of disc appears unchanged. Right neural foramen is patent. At L4 - 5: Small broad disc bulge and mild facet arthropathy. Mild spinal canal narrowing with no evidence of nerve root impingement within the spinal canal. Moderate to severe right and moderate left neural foraminal narrowing secondary to facet hypermobility, possibly some component of endplate osteophyte and disc on the right, similar to previous. At L5 - S1: No significant spinal canal stenosis. Mild left neural foraminal narrowing secondary to facet arthropathy. Limited assessment of the paraspinal soft tissues demonstrates no other significant abnormalities. IMPRESSION: 1. Multilevel degenerative change in the lumbar spine as described above.

FINDINGS:  5 lumbar type vertebral bodies are identified, as on prior plain radiograph. Conus medullaris is therefore noted to terminate normally at T12-L1. Alignment of the lumbar spine is satisfactory.     L3-4 is unremarkable. No significant stenosis seen.     L4-5 demonstrates minimal posterior disc bulge. Minimal degenerative facet joint change on the left is seen. No significant stenosis noted.     L5-S1 demonstrates mild loss of disc height. Circumferential disc bulge is seen with a superimposed large left paracentral disc protrusion. This indents the anterior aspect of the thecal sac, resulting in minimal central spinal stenosis. Protruded disc material also partially extends into the left lateral recess and contacts the traversing left S1 nerve root. Mild bilateral foraminal stenoses are also seen at this level.

761,0,"History:  Lower back pain, radicular symptoms. Has lower legs pain, numbness some  weakness.  Technique:  Standard protocol for lumbar spine.  Findings:  Assuming 5 lumbar vertebrae, normal conus medullaris terminates in L1.  Bone marrow signal and vertebral body height are normal.  Her congenitally short pedicles do predispose to central stenosis.  Variable (mild to moderate) disc degeneration is present in all levels between L2 and  S1.  No significant abnormality is seen above L2. There is no neural compromise.  In L2-3, a broad posterior disc bulge slightly indents the ventral thecal sac but does not  cause neural compromise. Facet joints are normal.  In L3-4, severe bilateral facet OA has resulted in mild (grade 1 or less) anterolisthesis.  The anterolisthesis, her congenitally smaller canal, hypertrophic change from facet joint  and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy all result in moderate/severe central stenosis  whereby the central canal is reduced to a sagittal dimension of barely 5 mm, appearing  to completely efface subarachnoid space at the disc level.  MRI LUMBAR SPINE  There is concurrent severe bilateral lateral recess, which could also compromise  bilateral descending L4 nerves where they exit the thecal sac. Bilateral neuroforamina  remain patent.  In L4-5, severe bilateral facet OA is associated with mild grade 1 degenerative  anterolisthesis. Similar to L3-4 above, constellation of findings result in mild central  stenosis. However, central canal is probably still adequate in this level, with some  preserved subarachnoid space. Neural foramina are patent.  In L5 1, there is severe bilateral facet OA without spondylolisthesis. The disc is actually  normal, and no neural compromise is seen in this level.  Impression:  A constellation of degenerative changes result in severe central stenosis in L3-4 along  with severe stenosis of the bilateral lateral recess. Clinical correlation is required  regarding cauda equina syndrome or L4 radiculopathy.  Mild central stenosis in L4-5 is due to the same Constellation of pathologies. However,  no convincing neural compromise is seen in this level.  There is severe bilateral facet OA in all levels from L3-4 to L5-S1."

Never_mind fractures. No spondylolisthesis. There demonstrates degenerative disc disease at L4 - 5 as detailed below. The remaining lumbar discs are reasonably well preserved, although there are some prominent anterior endplate osteophytes at L3 - 4 and smaller endplate osteophytes at the other lumbar levels. The conus medullaris lies at L1. UPGRADED_TO: T12 - L1 - Minor broad - based posterior disc bulge. No spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis. L1 - 2 - Normal disc. No spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis. L2 - 3 - Normal disc. No spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis. L3 - 4 - Normal disc. No spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis. Prominent anterior endplate osteophytes on the left side. L2 - 5 - Disc desiccation with mild loss of disc height and a small posterior annular tear. There is a small broad - based posterior disc bulge. There are severe bilateral facet joint degenerative changes. There is a 6 mm ovoid lesion at the medial aspect of the right L4 - 5 facet joint extending into the lateral recess, likely representing a synovial cyst, until there is no significant fluid signal. There are congenitally shortened pedicles. The combination of these findings is resulting in severe spinal stenosis with some effacement of the posterior epidural fat. There is mild buckling of the cauda equina proximal to this. There is severe bilateral lateral recess stenosis with impingement on the descending L5 nerve roots bilaterally. There is mild right neural foraminal narrowing without exiting nerve root impingement. L5 - S1 - Normal disc. No spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis. Mild bilateral facet joint degenerative changes. Other: There is a large exophytic cyst arising from the lower pole of the left kidney, measuring approximately 7. 2 cm in diameter. Probable small exophytic cyst in the interpolar region of the right surgery. OPINION: 1. Severe spinal stenosis at L4 - 5 secondary to a small broad - based posterior disc bulge, severe facet joint arthropathy and a new 6 mm right L4 - 5 facet joint synovial cyst extending into the right lateral Godefroidt. The appearances represent a deterioration from the previous MRI. 2. Mild degenerative changes elsewhere within the lumbar spine, but no further potentially_exculpatory of significant disc bulges, spinal stenosis or neural foraminal stenosis. 3.

Sagittal T1 and sagittal T2 - weighted imaging of the thoracic spine was also performed with axial T2 - weighted imaging from T6 / 7 to T9. Correlation is made to prior imaging, the most recent radiographs performed on August 28, 2019. FINDINGS: MRI CERVICAL SPINE: There is normal alignment of the vertebral bodies and facet joints with no significant noncash_impairment in vertebral body height. C2 / 3: No significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing. C3 / 4: No significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing. C4 / 5: Minimal disc osteophyte complex involves noted with no significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing.

C6 / 7: No significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing. C7 / T1: No significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing. MRI THORACIC SPINE: Small benign hemangioma is noted within the T6 vertebral body. Mild anterior wedging of the T8, T9, and T10 vertebral bodies is similar to the prior CT study of Septem_ber 28, 2019. Multilevel endplate degenerative changes with undulation of the endplates within the mid / lower thoracic spine associated with small Schmorl ' who¢_Ç¨_Ñ¢ nodes are also again noted. An exaggeration of the thoracic kyphosis centered at T8 / 9 is also similar to the prior CT study. There is otherwise normal Ikona_gear of the vertebral bodies and facet joints. On the localizer images, prominent T2 hyperintensity within the L5 vertebral body may relate to an underlying hemangioma. Small superior Schmorl ' s nodes are also noted at L5 and S1. Focal ventral distortion of the thoracic spinal cord knows noted at the level of T8, abutting fromthe T8 vertebral body. The posterior aspect of the thoracic spinal cord at the level of T8 has a focally angulated appearance. Abnormal T2 hyperintensity is noted within the thoracic spinal cord at the level of T8 extending to the level of T9. Hypertrophic degenerative facet arthropathy is contributing to mild neural foraminal narrowing at T11 / 12. No other significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing throughout the thoracic spine. IMPRESSION: Appearances are compatible with a spinal cord herniation at the level of T8. Abnormal T2 hyperintense signal within the thoracic spinal cord at T8 / 9 is compatible with cord edema / myelomalacia.

No convincing signal changes identified within the spinal cord.  No myelomalacia is suspected, but there is some mild compression as discussed below.    †  Above C4: There is mild disc desiccation but disc height is preserved.  No significant spondylosis is seen in the spinal canal and intervertebral foramina are widely patent.  †  C4-5: There is disc desiccation with mild anterior disc height loss and endplate degeneration.  No further spondylosis noted.  Spinal canal and intervertebral foramina widely patent.  †  C5-6: There is moderate degenerative disc disease with height loss and endplate change.  Moderate posterior disc osteophyte complex formation is present and extends to the uncovertebral joints, overall larger on the left side.  This results in mild spinal stenosis with effacement of the CSF in the thecal sac and with mild indentation of the spinal cord, more so on the left.  There is foraminal narrowing from the uncovertebral osteophytes to moderate to severe degree on the left and moderate degree on the right, and this may result in clinically significant exiting C6 nerve root impingement.  †  C6-7: There is disc desiccation with mild to moderate disc height loss.  Mild endplate degeneration is seen.  Mild posterior central focal disc protrusion is seen and mildly indents the thecal sac.  Moderate uncovertebral osteophytosis is seen bilaterally but is worse on the left.  The left foramen is moderately narrowed in the right foramen is mildly narrowed.  Minimal/mild narrowing of the spinal canal is less pronounced than at the C5-6 level.  †  C7-T4: There is mild disc desiccation at multiple levels but no significant disc height loss is seen.  Mild calcification of the posterior longitudinal ligament mildly encroaches upon the spinal canal and indents the thecal sac but does not appear to result in significant overall spinal stenosis.  Foramina appear widely patent.  †  IMPRESSION: There is considerable degenerative spondylosis at the C5-C7 levels, particularly C5-6.  There is associated degenerative disc height loss and endplate change as well as posterior disc bulging and herniation and uncovertebral osteophytosis.

At T11 - 12 and T12 - L1: Small disc protrusions are seen, with no significant spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis. At L1 - 2: Broad disc bulge results in mild narrowing of the spinal canal, unchanged with no evidence of nerve root impingement. Neural foramina are patent. At L2 - 3: Small broad disc bulge in combination with hypertrophic facet synovitis results in mild to moderate narrowing of the spinal canal, unchanged. Moderate right and mild left neural foraminal narrowing secondary to facet and endplate osteophyte has slightly increased. At L3 - 4: Small broad disc bulge in combination with hypertrophic facet arthropathy results in mild narrowing of the spinal canal, possibly slightly from October 2018. Severe left neural foraminal narrowing secondary to facet arthropathy and possible foraminal extent of disc appears unchanged. Right neural foramen is patent. At L4 - 5: Small broad disc bulge and mild glaring_deficiency arthropathy. Mild spinal canal narrowing with no evidence of nerve root impingement within the spinal canal. Moderate to severe right and moderate left neural foraminal narrowing secondary to facet arthropathy, possibly some component of endplate osteophyte and disc on the right, sharp_contrast to previous. At L5 - S1: No significant spinal canal stenosis. Mild left neural foraminal narrowing secondary to facet arthropathy. Limited assessment of the paraspinal soft tissues demonstrates no other significant abnormalities. IMPRESSION: 1. Multilevel degenerative change at current lumbar spine although described above. Mild spinal canal narrowing at L3 - 4 may have slightly increased. Otherwise no new spinal stenosis. 2. Severe left neural foraminal narrowing at L3 - 4 and moderate to severe right neural foraminal narrowing at L4 - 5 is better seen on the current study but allowing for technical factors appears similar.

Multilevel endplate degenerative changes with undulation of the endplates within the mid / lower thoracic spine associated with small Schmorl ' s nodes are also again noted. An exaggeration of the thoracic kyphosis centered at T8 / 9 is strongly similar to the prior CT study. There is otherwise normal alignment of the vertebral bodies and facet joints. On the localizer critique@myamericanartist.com, prominent T2 hyperintensity within the L5 vertebral body may relate to an underlying hemangioma. Small superior Schmorl ' s nodes are also noted at L5 and S1. Focal ventral distortion of the thoracic spinal cord is noted at the level of T8, abutting the T8 vertebral body. The posterior aspect of the thoracic spinal cord at the level of T8 has a focally angulated appearance.

Conus medullaris is not optimally seen, but appears to terminate around the L1 level.  †  Mild reversal cervical lordosis and mild anterolisthesis of C3 on C4, favored to be chronic. Moderate left convex curvature of the lumbar spine centered at L4 due to height loss in the right side of the L4 vertebra appears unchanged from April 6, 2020, mildly increased from August 1, 2018. Grade 1 anterolisthesis of L5 on S1 is also unchanged and is associated with bilateral pars intra-articular is defects and severe facet arthropathy on CT.  †  Cervical:  Marrow signal is diffusely decreased. There is subtle STIR hyperintensity and minor enhancement within the C3-C6 vertebra, with multilevel associated degenerative change. Multiple small disc osteophyte formations are seen in the cervical spine, with no significant spinal canal stenosis.

No significant spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis is identified in the thoracic region the thoracic spinal cord appears normal in caliber and signal intensity within the limits of this study.   †  Limited assessment of the thoracic paraspinal soft tissues demonstrates no other significant abnormalities.  †  Lumbar:  Modic type II degenerative endplate signal change without significant enhancement at the L2-3 level. Mild edema and enhancement of the endplates on either side of the L3-4 disc space. Prominent Schmorl's nodes suspected in the superior endplate of L4. Modic type II degenerative endplate signal change without significant enhancement or edema in the endplates about the L4-5 disc space. Mild edema and enhancement slight endplate irregularity about the L5-S1 disc space.

Mild enhancement within the C3-C6 vertebra, within the endplates on either side of the L1-2, L3-4, and L5-S1 disc spaces, and in the right L3-4 through L5-S1 facets could largely reflect changes of active arthropathy. However, a low-grade or multifocal infection particularly at the lumbar sites of enhancement would be difficult to exclude on MRI.

URGENT     COMPARISON: Previous x-ray May 2/17 (Hardisty Heatlh Centre).     TECHNIQUE: Routine non-augmented L-spine radiculopathy protocol.     FINDINGS:  5 lumbar type vertebral bodies are identified, as on prior plain radiograph. Conus medullaris is therefore noted to terminate normally at L1. There is limited visualization of the thoracolumbar junction. However, very minimal anterior wedging is seen. Schmorl's nodes are noted involving the superior and inferior endplates of T12, as well as the superior endplate of L1. This may relate to congenital Scheuermann's disease.     T11-12 demonstrates loss of disc height. Minimal posterior disc osteophyte complex is seen, along with mild degenerative facet joint change bilaterally. No stiffness stenosis results at this level.     T12-L1 demonstrates mild degenerative facet joint change bilaterally. No significant stenosis seen.     L1-2 and L2-3 are unremarkable, as assessed on sagittal sequences. No significant stenosis seen.     L3-4 demonstrates minimal degenerative facet joint change on the left. No stenosis seen at this level.     L4-5 demonstrates a small left paracentral disc protrusion and associated annular tear. T2 bright material is seen extending from the left paracentral annular tear inferior to the disc level. This extends into the right lateral recess measuring approximately 4 x 8 x 9 mm (AP x T x CC) in size. This is favored to represent sequelae of a sequestered disc fragment, and is compressing the traversing right L5 nerve root within the lateral recess. Mild degenerative facet joint changes are seen bilaterally. There is minimal stenosis of the left lateral recess also noted at this level. No other significant stenosis seen.     L5-S1 demonstrates a small central disc protrusion. In addition, there is a small 7 mm disc fragment seen to the right of midline just above this level. This is probably another small sequestered disc fragment. This may be coming from the L5-S1 disc, or possibly from the L4-5 disc above. In any event, this disc fragment is compressing the right L5 nerve root just prior to entering the right neural foramen. Mild degenerative facet joint changes are seen bilaterally. No other significant stenosis seen at this level.     IMPRESSION: Sequestered disc fragment within the right lateral recess at L4-5, probably arising from the L4-5 disc level.

Technique: Routine lumbar spine protocol is performed. Findings: Lumbar spine alignment is normal. Vertebral body heights are maintained. The conus medullaris and regia equina are normal. At the T12 - L1 level the disc is normal. The thecal sac and exiting nerve roots are free of compression. At the L1 - 2 level there is a small left paracentral disc protrusion which minimally compresses the anterior aspect of the thecal sac on the left. The exiting and transiting nerve roots are free of compression. At the L2 - 3 level there is some circumferential disc bulging causing minimal compression on the anterior aspect of the thecal sac. The exiting and transiting nerve roots are free of compression. At the L3 - 4 level there is circumferential disc bulging with a small right paracentral disc protrusion. There is minimal compression on the anterior aspect of the thecal sac and some mild supination recess stenosis is seen. There is some mild foraminal encroachment bilaterally but no definite exiting nerve root or transiting nerve root compressions are seen. Altogether then L4 - 5 level there is circumferential disc bulging with a small to moderate posterior midline disc protrusion with moderate severe facet joint osteoarthritis bilaterally. This causes mild central canal stenosis and moderate severe lateral recess stenosis bilaterally. The exiting nerve roots are free of compression. There is severe transiting nerve root compression bilaterally. At the L5 - S1 level there is circumferential disc bulging. There is a 14 x 9 x 12 mm mass identified inall the left lateral recess at the level of the L5 vertebral body likely representing extruded disc material however a neurofibroma or other neoplastic lesion would be in the differential diagnosis. Usually causes moderate compression of the left anterolateral aspect of the thecal sac. Certainly appears to be causing severe compression of our exiting left L5 nerve root as it enters the foramina. Transiting nerve roots remain free of compression. The exiting right nerve root is free of compression. There is severe facet joint osteoarthritis conjectured bilaterally. IMPRESSION: Multilevel degenerative disc changes with facet joint osteoarthritis at several levels. Masslike abnormality in the left lateral recess superior to the L5 - S1 disc space causing severe compression of the exiting left L5 nerve root. This most likely represents extruded disc material however a neoplastic lesion cannot be completely excluded. Further investigation with a contrast - enhanced study could be helpful.

991,0,"TECHNIQUE: MRI of the lumbar spine was performed utilizing sagittal T1, T2, and STIR sequences through the entire lumbar spine, with axial T1 and T2 sequences through the lower 3 disc levels.  †  FINDINGS: Comparison is made to lumbar spine x-rays from October 07, 2019 and June 04, 2011.  These x-rays demonstrate 5 lumbar type vertebral bodies, as well as a cyst with a sclerotic margin along the posterior portion of the L4 vertebral body.  †  The MRI also demonstrates a cyst within the posterior aspect of the L4 vertebral body, along its left aspect.  This cyst measures 1.5 cm craniocaudad by 1 cm AP by 0.9 cm transverse, and appears stable when compared to the prior x-rays.  The MRI also demonstrates a low T1 and T2 signal intensity rim, consistent with the sclerosis on the x-rays.  This is associated with endplate irregularity along the superior aspect of the L4 vertebral body, which suggests that this is degenerative in etiology.  There is a small amount of fibrovascular endplate degenerative changes along the posterior left aspect of the L5-S1 level, preferentially involving the L5 endplate.  There is also evidence of extensive fatty endplate degenerative changes along the anterior aspect of the L4-L5 level.  Anterior osteophytes at multiple levels, preferentially at the L4-L5 level.  †  The visualized portion of the retroperitoneum is within normal limits.  The paraspinous musculature is unremarkable.  The conus medullaris is normal in appearance, and terminates normally at approximately the L1-L2 disc level.  †  The visualized portion of the lower thoracic spine and the upper lumbar spine demonstrate relatively normal discs, with no significant spinal canal/neural foraminal narrowing.  †  L3-L4: There is mild degenerative disc disease, with loss of normal disc signal, endplate irregularity, tiny anterior osteophytes, and subtle loss of disc height.  The cyst within the L4 vertebral body has been described previously.  There is also a tiny right foraminal disc protrusion that results in mild right inferior neural foraminal narrowing, but no evidence of compression of the exiting right L3 nerve root.  No significant spinal canal narrowing at this level.  No significant facet arthropathy.  †  L4-L5: There is moderate degenerative disc disease, with moderate loss of disc height, loss of disc signal, fatty endplate degenerative change, anterior osteophytes, and a mild diffuse disc bulge.  No significant facet arthropathy.  These findings result in minimal spinal canal narrowing, but no evidence of compression or displacement of the L5 nerve roots within the lateral recesses.  There is also evidence of mild bilateral inferior neural foraminal narrowing, but no evidence of compression of the exiting nerve roots.  †  L5-S1: There is mild to moderate degenerative disc disease, with preferential disc height loss along the left aspect of the disc level, where there is also a small amount of fibrovascular endplate degenerative change.  There is also loss of disc signal.  There is a mild disc bulge with a superimposed left paracentral disc protrusion.  No significant facet arthropathy or ligamentum flavum hypertrophy.  These findings result in left lateral recess narrowing with posterior displacement and mild flattening of the left S1 nerve root, concerning for compression.  Mild bilateral inferior neural foraminal narrowing, but no evidence of definitive compression of the exiting nerve roots.  †  IMPRESSION:  †  The L5-S1 level demonstrates mild to moderate degenerative disc disease, preferentially along the left aspect, where there is also left-sided fibrovascular endplate degenerative changes.  There is also a left paracentral disc protrusion at this level which results in posterior displacement and what appears to be mild compression of the left S1 nerve root within the lateral recess.  This could be a cause of the patient's left-sided symptoms.  †  2.          Moderate degenerative disc disease at the L4-L5 level, with associated fatty endplate degenerative changes and a mild diffuse disc bulge, but no significant spinal canal/neural foraminal narrowing.  †  3.          Mild degenerative disc disease at the L3-L4 level.  There are findings most suggestive of a degenerative endplate cyst arising off of the superior endplate of L4 and extending into the left/posterior aspect of the L4 vertebral body.  This is an unusual degenerative endplate finding, but the fact that the cyst was seen on the 2011 x-rays, and is grossly stable when compared to the prior x-rays, suggests that this is a benign finding.  †  The Workers' Compensation Board has requested that we provide a professional opinion as to whether the imaging findings are related whole or in part to the injury in question. This is not considered part of the official diagnostic imaging report, and will only be used to help a WCB caseworker decide whether the injury is work-related or not.

Ç A trastuzumab_DM1_T_DM1 history of "" chronic back pain bluebloods_Purdue motor vehicle accident in 1993 "" has been provided. Ç TECHNICAL: Ç Sagittal and axial T1 - and T2 - weighted sequences were performed. Ç FINDINGS: Ç Transitional anatomy is present at the level of the lumbosacral junction. For the purposes of this report (as well as to remain consistent with the prior radiograph reports ), the inferiormost fully - formed disc will be labeled the L5 / S1 level. Note is made of an underdeveloped disc at the S1 / 2 level as well as an anterolisthesis of the body of L3 with respect to the body of L4. A mild curvature is present convex to the left. The vertebral body heights are well - maintained and appear unchanged in the interval. The bone marrow signal is fairly homogeneous allowing for degenerative proximal_tibial changes at several levels, most notably at the L4 / 5 level and at the L3 / 4 level. The conus medullaris terminates normally at approximately the level of the T12 / L1 intervertebral disc. The a small incidental perineural hydatid_cyst is noted within the sacral spinal canal at the S2 level. Ç At the S1 / 2 echelon, an underdeveloped DvD is noted. No significant neural foraminal compromise or compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated. now¢_Ç¨ At the L5 / S1 level, the intervertebral disc is unremarkable. A pseudoarthrosis with associated degenerative change is present involving the transverse process of L5 with the sacrum on the left side. Mild degenerative changes are present involving the facet calf_muscles. No significant neural foraminal compromise or compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated. Ç At the L4 / 5 level, a small anterior osteophyte is noted straddling the midline, more prominent to the left of midline. Degenerative endplate changes are present, more prominent eccentric to the left. Narrowing of the intervertebral disc is present, advanced on the left and mild to moderate on the right. A small amount of vacuum phenomenon is present within the intervertebral disc eccentric to the left. Disc / osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline which extends laterally protruding into the inferior aspect of the neural foramen bilaterally, more prominent on the left side. The posterior disc / osteophyte complex does not appear to involve the traversing L5 nerve roots. Degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints, moderate on the left and mild on the right. There is borderline hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum. The findings are resulting in moderate compromise of the left neural foramen and minimal / mild compromise of the right neural foramen. No significant compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated. Ç At the L3 / 4 level, moderate - to - advanced degenerative endplate changes are present along with marked narrowing of the intervertebral disc. Vacuum phenomenon is present within the intervertebral disc. A defect is present within the pars interarticularis bilaterally at the L3 level with an associated anterolisthesis of the body of L3 with respect to the body of L4 measuring approximately 8 mm resulting in uncovering of the posterior aspect of the intervertebral disc. Disc / osteophyte complex is present laterally protruding into the region of the neural foramen bilaterally. Mild degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints. The findings are resulting in severe compromise of the right neural foramen and moderate - to - severe compromise of the left neural foramen. No significant compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated. Ç The remainder of the visualized levels is unremarkable allowing for minor degenerative disc and facet joint changes. Ç Atheromatous irregularity is present involving the abdominal liver extending into the iliac arteries bilaterally. To the extent visualized, regional soft tissue structures are otherwise unremarkable. Ç IMPRESSION: Ç Transitional anatomy is present at the level of the lumbosacral junction, as stated above. Radiographic correlation is recommended in an effort to ensure accurate localization, especially prior to any interventional procedure. Ç Degenerative change is present involving the intervertebral disc and the facet joints at multiple levels resulting in neural foraminal compromise at several levels, most striking bilaterally at the L3 / 4 level as well as on the left side at the L4 / 5 level, as detailed above. Bilateral spondylolysis is present at the L3 level resulting in a grade 2 anterolisthesis of the body of L3 with respect to the body of L4 and associated bilateral neural foraminal compromise, as discussed. The degree of anterolisthesis at the L3 / 4 level Q.Is relatively unchanged when compared with the radiographs performed 17 August, 2020. Ç"

1020,0,"Reason for Exam: R/O CAUDA EQINA-SENSORY LOSS/PARESTHESIAS-C2           ******** ADDENDUM #1 ********     The CT chest from May 28, 2019 and CT abdomen/pelvis from May 29, 2019 (both performed at UAH) were reviewed. The multiple small lytic lesions with sclerotic rims scattered within the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae, sacrum and left and right ilium on the CT studies demonstrate subtle central hypointense T1 and heterogenous T2 signal. Some lesions have a subtle rim of T1 hyperintensity at their periphery. The MR appearance is nonspecific. Infectious, granulomatous and malignant etiologies would have to be considered in the differential. A PET/CT scan may be of benefit to determine if these lesions are metabolically active and assess for a potential site for biopsy.    HISTORY:   As above.     TECHNIQUE:   Large field-of-view sagittal T1 and T2 imaging of the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine was first obtained. Sagittal T2 imaging of the lumbar spine and axial T1 and T2 imaging from L2-3 to L5-S1 was then acquired.     FINDINGS:  Lumbar spine x-rays from May 2013 2019 (Grey Nuns Hospital), thoracic spine x-rays from May 9, 2019 (MIC Tawa Centre) and cervical spine x-rays from May 1, 2017 (Insight Medical Imaging) were reviewed.     CERVICAL SPINE:  Straightening of the cervical spine noted. Vertebral body heights are maintained. Prevertebral soft tissues, craniocervical junction and visualized posterior fossa structures are unremarkable. Marrow signal is unremarkable.     There is mild soft tissue prominence posterior to the odontoid, indenting the ventral thecal sac but not causing any spinal cord impingement. This is of doubtful significance. The odontoid itself is intact with no erosions or osseous destruction apparent. Atlanto-dental interval is normal.     The cervical spinal cord is normal. No spinal stenosis at any level.     Moderate disc space narrowing and small posterior disc-osteophyte complex noted at C5-6. This does not affect the spinal cord. Probable mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing at this level. NO significant degenerative changes in the remainder of the cervical spine.        THORACIC SPINE:  Alignment is unremarkable. Prevertebral soft tissues are unremarkable. Small Schmorl's nodes noted at some levels. No focal destructive osseous lesions.     Thoracic spinal cord and conus are normal. Conus terminates at the T12 level. No fatty filum terminale.     Small posterior disc-osteophyte complexes at the T7-8, T9-10, T10-11, T11-12 and T12-L1 levels indent the thecal sac but do not affect the spinal cord or exiting nerve roots. No significant spinal stenosis or neural foraminal stenosis at any level.        LUMBAR SPINE:  Five lumbar type vertebrae are present. There is ventral downsloping of the superior endplate of L1, which appears remote. There is mild downsloping of the superior endplate of L2 also, which also appears old. Heights of the other lumbar vertebral bodies are maintained. Moderately advanced degenerative endplate changes are present within the L3 and L4 vertebral bodies. Patchy fatty marrow within the L1 and L2 vertebral bodies and along the L5-S1 endplates is likely degenerative in etiology also.     At L1-2, there is mild loss of disc height. A small posterior disc bulge indents the thecal sac. There is no nerve root impingement or spinal stenosis. No significant neural foraminal narrowing.     At L2-3, disc height is preserved. There is diffuse hypointense T2 signal indicative of disc degeneration. A small annular disc bulge mildly indents the ventral thecal sac. There is no nerve root impingement, spinal stenosis or lateral recess narrowing. Mild bilateral facet degenerative changes.     At L3-4, there is moderate to severe loss of disc height eccentrically towards the right, associated with mild degenerative endplate changes and small anterior osteophytes. Mild bilateral facet degenerative changes and ligamentum flavum thickening noted. A small broad-based posterior disc-osteophyte complex indents the thecal sac and encroaches upon the inferior aspect of both neural foramina, more so on the right, resulting in moderate stenosis of the right neural foramen and mild narrowing of the left neural foramen. Slight narrowing of both lateral recesses noted. Slight transverse narrowing of the thecal sac but no significant spinal stenosis.     At L4-5, there is grade I anterolisthesis of 3 mm. This is likely secondary to moderate to severe bilateral facet arthropathy at this level, associated with thickening of the ligamentum flavum. Moderate-sized joint effusions noted bilaterally also. A broad-based posterior disc bulge indents the ventral thecal sac. There is an extradural lesion just above the disc level anterolaterally towards the left within the spinal canal, demonstrating heterogeneous T2 and hypointense T1 signal. This measures approximately 15 mm AP x 14 mm TR x 11 mm CC. Its etiology is unclear. It may represent an unusual perineural cyst, synovial cyst or chronic sequestered disc fragment. It compresses the thecal sac and effaces the left lateral recess, with the exiting left L4 nerve root stretched around it. Of note, this lesion was present in retrospect on a CT abdomen/pelvis study from July 5, 2017 (UAH), associated with some regional bony remodeling at that time, and similar in size. At the disc level, there   is severe stenosis of the left lateral recess, moderate narrowing of the right lateral recess, and moderate to severe spinal stenosis. Moderate to severe stenosis of the left neural foramen noted with effacement of the fat around the exiting left L4 nerve root. Mild narrowing of the right neural foramen. These findings are also similar to the 2017 CT study.     At L5-S1, there is mild loss of disc height posteriorly. There is a small shallow disc protrusion paracentrally on the left, abutting but not displacing the descending left S1 nerve root. Mild bilateral facet degenerative changes. Slight narrowing of the left lateral recess and moderate stenosis of the left neural foramen. No stenosis of the right lateral recess or right neural foramen. No spinal stenosis.     Visualized sacroiliac joints are unremarkable.     OPINION:  1. Normal spinal cord.     2. Mild degenerative changes of the cervical and thoracic spine.     3. Multilevel degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine. Unusual extradural lesion at the inferior L4 level anterolaterally towards the left, compressing the thecal sac and narrowing the left lateral recess. This is of uncertain etiology but appears grossly unchanged in size compared to a CT abdomen/pelvis study from 2017. Differential diagnosis includes a synovial cyst, atypical perineural cyst or chronic sequestered disc fragment.     4. Bilateral lateral recess stenoses (left greater than right), moderate to severe spinal stenosis and moderate to severe left neural foraminal stenosis at L4-5. Moderate stenosis of the left L5-S1 neural foramen. These findings are also similar to the 2017 CT examination."

Five lumbar vertebrae of normal morphology are visualized. The lumbar spine lordosis is maintained. Vertebral body heights are preserved. No suspicious bone marrow signal abnormality. The conus medullaris is normal in appearance and terminates at the L1 vertebral body level. Of note, the incompletely assessed uterus appears bulky and a possible submucosal fibroid is seen, distorting the endometrial lining. Levels T10 - T11 to L1 - L2 are unremarkable. The patient tiny posterior disc bulge_outward is present at L2 - L3. Neural foramina remain patent. No spinal canal stenosis. No trophoblast_cells enhancement seen on post gadolinium imaging. L3 - 4: 8 mm anterolisthesis of L3 on L4 associated with superior uncovering of the disc posteriorly. There is a superimposed small posterior central disc protrusion. Adjacent endplates show diffuse low T1 signal. Evidence of the right hemilaminectomy. Advanced left facet hypertrophic osteoarthritis is present and a ##and x 5 x 7 mm (AP x TR x PL) presumed synovial cyst protrudes anteromedially into the spinal canal, further contributing to the overall moderate to severe spinal canal stenosis. A linear area of increased T2 signal is also seen about the right facet joint medially, possibly representing a hypopnea or residual synovial cyst. The left lateral recess is obliterated, accounting for compression of the left L4 traversing nerve root. There is moderate skated_gingerly and mild right neural foramina narrowing. L4 - 5: There is a small central disc extrusion indenting the anterior aspect of the thecal sac. Advanced left facet hypertrophic osteoarthritis is present with asymmetrical thickening of the ligamentum flavum, further contributing to the distortion of the spinal canal. No spinal canal stenosis. The previously visualized synovial cyst arising from the right facet joint has been surgically removed. Lateral recesses remain patent. There is mild left neural foramen narrowing. L5 - S1: Disc height is severely reduced and pronounced surrounding endplate osteophytes are present. There is a broad - based posterior disc bulge with a small left central protrusion abutting the traversing left S1 nerve root. Mild bilateral facet osteoarthritis is noted. Neural foramen are bilaterally patent. No spinal canal stenosis. SUMMARY: 1. 8 mm anterolisthesis of L3 on L4 associated with severe hypertrophic left facet osteoarthritis and a small synovial cyst protruding anteromedially, further contributing to the overall moderate to severe spinal_fusion canal stenosis Mon_Sat this level. The traversing left L4 nerve root is compressed in the lateral recess. This is dramatically worsened compared with December 2017 MRI. 2.

A mild circumferential disc bulge is present, with the anteroposterior diameter of the vertebral foramen still maintained.  Ç†  L4/5 LEVEL:  Narrowing of both neural foramina are present, right more than left side, and early compression of the exiting L4 nerve root  sleeve should be considered.  Both facets demonstrate trivial degenerative change, with significant ligamenta flava hypertrophy.  In combination with a mild circumferential disc bulge the anteroposterior diameter of the vertebral foramen is narrowed,  measuring 10.4 mm, which is consistent with spinal stenosis.  Secondary to this, flattening of the anterior aspect of the thecal  sac is noted, as well as early suspected compression of both descending L5 roots at pre recess level.  In association with  ligamenta flava hypertrophy, lateral narrowing of the vertebral foramen is also present.  Ç†  L5/S1 LEVEL:  Mild left side neural foraminal narrowing is noted, with the right side appearing unremarkable.  No definite exiting nerve root  sleeve compression.

1052,0,"MRI LUMBAR SPINE  MRI SACROILIAC JOINTS  TECHNIQUE: Sagittal T1, T2, and STIR sequences were obtained through the entire  lumbar spine, with axial T1 and T2 sequences through the lower 3 disc levels. Oblique  coronal T1, STIR, T1 fat saturation and oblique axial T2 fat saturation sequences were  obtained through the sacroiliac joints.  FINDINGS: The lumbar spine x-rays from December 05, 2019 demonstrate 5 lumbar  type vertebral bodies.  There is a normal lordotic curvature and alignment of the lumbar spine. Vertebral body  heights are well-maintained, with a tiny amount of bone marrow edema involving the  right L5-S1 endplates, consistent with fibrovascular endplate degenerative change.  The visualized portion of the retroperitoneum is within normal limits. The paraspinous  musculature is unremarkable. The conus medullaris is normal in appearance, and  terminates normally at approximately the L1 level.  The visualized portion of the lower thoracic spine and the upper lumbar spine  demonstrates normal discs, with no evidence of spinal canal/neural foraminal  narrowing.  L3-L4: Unremarkable.  L4-L5: There is mild degenerative disc disease, with mild loss of disc height, loss of  disc signal, and a mild diffuse disc bulge with a tiny superimposed left paracentral disc  protrusion and annular tear. Unremarkable facet joints. These findings result in  minimal narrowing of both lateral recesses, left greater than right, but no evidence of  compression or displacement of either L5 nerve root. No significant neural foraminal narrowing.  L5-S1: There is mild degenerative disc disease, with mild loss of disc height and subtle  loss of disc signal. There is a large right paracentral/foraminal disc extrusion, which  extends superior to the inferior endplate of L5 by 1 cm (sequence 2 image 5 the disc  extrusion measures approximately 2 cm transverse (sequence 5 image 19).  Unremarkable facet joints. The disc extrusion results in marked narrowing of the right  lateral recess, with inward displacement of the right S1 nerve root as well as mild  flattening of this nerve root, concerning for compression. There is also right inferior  neural foraminal narrowing, with the disc extrusion abutting the inferior aspect of the  exiting right L5 nerve root, also concerning for mild compression.  Right sacroiliac joint: No evidence of joint space widening, narrowing, or ankylosis. No  evidence of bone marrow edema, erosions, or fatty marrow change. No evidence of a  joint effusion or surrounding soft tissue edema.  Left sacroiliac joint: No evidence of joint space widening, narrowing, or ankylosis. No  evidence of bone marrow edema, erosions, or fatty marrow change. No evidence of a  joint effusion or surrounding soft tissue edema.  IMPRESSION:  1. Mild degenerative disc disease at the L5-S1 level, with a large right  paracentral/foraminal disc protrusion and a small amount of right-sided fibrovascular  endplate degenerative change. The disc extrusion results in inward displacement  and possible mild compression of the right S1 nerve root within the lateral recess.  There is also right inferior neural foraminal narrowing, with possible mild  compression of the exiting right L5 nerve root. These findings are likely causing the patient's right-sided back pain.  2. Mild degenerative disc disease at the L4-L5 level, but no evidence of compression of any nerve root at this level.  3. Unremarkable sacroiliac joints.  "

1061,0,"MR LUMBAR SPINE   Reason for Exam: AFTER PREGNANCY, SEVERE BUTTOCK AND LEFT-SIDED JOINT PAIN ON LYING ON FLAT SURFACE.  NOT IMPROVING WITH CONSERVATIVE MANAGEMENT.  ?DISC DISEASE  VERSUS SI JOINT DISEASE  †  COMPARISON: Radiograph of the lumbar spine and pelvis January 22, 2021.  Thoracic spine radiograph October 26, 2018.  †  TECHNIQUE: Multi sequential multiplanar MRI of the lumbar spine and sacroiliac joints as per departmental protocol.  †  FINDINGS:  †  The prior thoracic spine radiograph demonstrates 12 rib-bearing thoracic vertebrae.  There is lumbosacral transitional anatomy.  The prior lumbar spine radiograph demonstrates 6 nonrib-bearing lumbar vertebrae with complete lumbarization of S1.  For the purposes of today's study, the most well formed inferior disc space will be denoted as S1-S2.  †  LUMBAR SPINE:  †  Lumbosacral alignment is unremarkable.  †  Normal lumbar lordosis.  Small intervertebral hemangioma in L2.  †  There is mild loss of the intranuclear T2 signal of the L5-S1 and S1-S2 disc reflecting mild degenerative disc disease.  Disc heights spaces are preserved.  Vertebral body morphology is preserved.  †  The conus medullaris terminates at T12-L1 and demonstrates a normal appearance.  The cauda equina nerve roots are unremarkable.  †  T12-L3: Unremarkable.  †  †  Axial sequences were obtained from L4 to S2.  †  L4-L5: Unremarkable.  †  L5-S1: There is a very small central disc bulge with a thin linear area of increased T2 signal in the posterior aspect of the disc likely reflecting a posterior annular fissure.  No significant central canal or neural foraminal stenosis.  The facet joints appear unremarkable.  †  S1-S2: Small posterior disc bulge.  No significant central canal or neural foraminal stenosis.  The facet joints are unremarkable.  †  There is a large Tarlov cyst within the right S2 neural foramen measuring 2.5 x 1.8 x 2.4 cm which is seen to anterolaterally displace and compress the exiting right S2 nerve root within the neural foramen.  Multiple smaller left-sided Tarlov cysts are noted involving the left S1 and S2 level.  The left S2 nerve root though appears unremarkable throughout its course.  †  The anterior and posterior paraspinal soft tissues are unremarkable.  †  †  SACROILIAC JOINTS:  †  The sacroiliac joint spaces are preserved.  There is surface cortical irregularity as well as subchondral signal abnormality involving the anterior aspect of the sacroiliac joints predominantly along the iliac portion were there is mild focal subchondral bone marrow edema.  No definite erosions.  No ankylosis.  No joint effusion.  †  No fatty metaplasia.  †  Overlying soft tissues are unremarkable.  †  There is a functional follicle in the right adnexa measuring 2.6 x 1.4 cm.  A physiologic sliver of fluid is noted in the pelvis.  †  The endometrium is unremarkable for the age of the patient.  †  A small intraosseous cyst is noted in the left femoral head neck junction of the left hip.  †  †  CONCLUSION:  †  The prior thoracic spine radiograph demonstrates 12 rib-bearing thoracic vertebrae.  There is lumbosacral transitional anatomy.  The prior lumbar spine radiograph demonstrates 6 nonrib-bearing lumbar vertebrae with complete lumbarization of S1.  For the purposes of today's study, the most well formed inferior disc space will be denoted as S1-S2.  †  1.  No evidence of a inflammatory spondyloarthropathy.  †  2.  Mild degenerative changes of the sacroiliac joints are noted bilaterally, likely related to altered biomechanics as a result of pregnancy.  †  3.  Posterior annular disc fissure of the L5-S1 disc which may be a pain generator.  †  4.  No significant central canal or neural foraminal stenosis throughout the lumbar spine.  †  5.  There is a large right-sided Tarlov cyst compressing the right S2 nerve root as outlined above.  I do note that the patient's symptoms are predominantly left-sided, suggesting that this finding is incidental."

1068,1,"FINDINGS: Spine radiographs from 30 November, 2017 reviewed.  The lumbar spine CT from 5 March, 2013 was also reviewed.  Ç†  Overall alignment of the lumbar spine is normal.  Some lumbar spine straightening may simply be positional.  Vertebral body heights are maintained allowing for chronic mild anterior compression fracture of L3.  Vertebral body height maintained posteriorly.  The conus terminates normally at the superior endplate of L1.  Paraspinal soft tissues unremarkable.  Ç†  T11/T12 shows only minimal degenerative disc disease and no spinal stenosis or exit neural foraminal stenosis.  Ç†  T12/L1 shows worsening disc desiccation and annular disc bulging but no spinal stenosis or exit neural foraminal stenosis.  Ç†  L1/L2 through L3/L4 are all essentially unremarkable with no significant spinal stenosis or exit neural foraminal stenosis.  Ç†  At L4/L5 there is disc desiccation and a broad-based midline disc extrusion which effaces the thecal sac anteriorly.  This is an AP thickness of about 4 to 5 mm and extends caudally about 7 mm along the posterior margin of the L5 vertebral body.  This moderate facet osteoarthritis on the left with some ligamentum flavum hypertrophy.  These findings in combination produce a moderate exit neural foraminal stenosis on the left.  Possible irritation of the transiting L5 nerve root in the lateral recess.  Only mild neural foraminal narrowing on the left.  Ç†  At L5/S1 there is some broad-based posterior disc bulging with a small right paracentral disc protrusion.  This causes no spinal stenosis or exit neural foraminal stenosis, but could conceivably be irritating the transiting S1 nerve root in the lateral recess positionally.  Ç†  SUMMARY:  Ç†  Multilevel degenerative disc disease as described.  Ç†  Disc extrusion at L4/L5 in combination with left facet hypertrophy and ligamentum flavum thickening produces a moderate exit neural foraminal stenosis and possible lateral recess stenosis on the left.

Vertebral body heights are maintained.  No acute compression fractures.  Conus terminates at approximately L1, within normal limits.  Patchy heterogenous marrow signal, similar to previous.  †  T12-L1: No spinal canal stenosis.  †  L-1-L2: No spinal canal stenosis.  Disc height is maintained.  †  L2-L3: Moderate disc space narrowing.  Posterior disc osteophyte complex eccentric to the left abuts the ventral thecal sac and results in mild narrowing of the left lateral recess.  No significant spinal canal stenosis.  The right neural foramina is patent.  Disc material extends into inferior left neural foramina resulting in mild/moderate stenosis.  Mild left facet arthropathy.  †  L3-L4: Severe loss of disc height.  Small posterior disc osteophyte complex abuts the ventral thecal sac.  In conjunction with ligamentum flavum hypertrophy, mild spinal canal stenosis.  Mild left and mild right neural foraminal stenosis.  Mild bilateral facet arthropathy, more so on the left.  †  L4-L5: Grade 1 anterolisthesis by 3 mm, unchanged.  Disc desiccation and minor loss of disc height.  Circumferential broad-based disc bulging.  In conjunction with ligamentum flavum hypertrophy, resultant mild spinal canal stenosis.  Mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing.  Mild to moderate bilateral facet arthropathy.  †  L5-S1: Severe loss of intervertebral disc height.  Small posterior disc osteophyte complex which abuts the ventral thecal sac.  No significant spinal canal stenosis.  Moderate bilateral facet hypertrophic changes.  The findings results in moderate right-sided neural foraminal narrowing, and mild to moderate left neural foraminal narrowing.  †  The known complex cystic structure within the left adnexa is not completely imaged.  This was better characterized on the MRI pelvis from January 12, 2016.  Measures at least 5.7 cm.  †  IMPRESSION:  1. Multilevel degenerative changes, overall fairly similar to prior MRI from 2015.  No severe spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis.  At L5-S1, there is again severe degenerative disc disease and moderate right neural foraminal narrowing with possible involvement of the exiting L5 nerve root.  †  2. Heterogenous marrow signal is again noted and similar dating back to 2015.  Given the negative bone scan from 2015/ relative long-term stability, findings would suggest a benign process.  †  3.

COMPARISON: Lumbar radiographs from April 2, 2016.     FINDINGS:     There are 5 lumbar type vertebrae. Mild degenerative retrolisthesis of L2 on L3, L3 on L4, and L5 on S1. Vertebral body heights are overall preserved with no significant vertebral compression fracture. Modic type endplate changes at multiple levels and a few small Schmorl's nodes, the largest in the inferior endplate of L2. No aggressive bone marrow signal. The conus medullaris terminates normally at the L1-L2 intervertebral level. The visualized spinal cord and intervertebral discs are normal in signal intensity.     At T11-T12, moderate/severe disc height loss with disc ossification and anterior osteophytes. Tiny posterior disc bulge. No spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis.     At T12-L1, disc desiccation with overall preserved height. Anterior osteophytes. No disc bulge/protrusion. No significant neural foraminal or spinal canal stenosis.     At L1-L2, disc desiccation with overall preserved height. Anterior osteophytes. No disc bulge/protrusion. Minimal bilateral facet arthropathy.

At L3-L4, mild disc height loss with a moderate broad-based posterior disc bulge and large anterior osteophytes. Moderate bilateral facet arthropathy and significant left ligamentum flavum hypertrophy. Resultant severe left and mild right neural foraminal stenosis. The descending left L4 nerve root is displaced by the hypertrophy, although it is not significantly impinged in the lateral recess. No significant spinal canal stenosis.     At L4-L5, mild disc height loss with a moderate broad-based posterior disc bulge. Moderate/severe facet arthropathy and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy.

1091,0,"MR CERVICAL SPINE:    Ç†  History: New onset of neck pain with abrupt left C5 decrease in motor function. CT shows high-grade spinal stenosis at C4-C5    Ç†  Protocol: Routine sequences including sagittal T2, sagittal T1, axial T2 and axial MEDIC.    Ç†  FINDINGS:    Ç†  Straightening of the cervical spine is seen along its length which is nonspecific but quite likely positional. Study includes   evaluation from the base of the skull through the mid T5 level.    Ç†  Craniocervical alignment is normal and assessment of the C1-C2 level is normal.    Ç†  C2-3: At C2-C3, disc height is maintained. No other vertebral osteophytosis is present. No significant facet degeneration is seen  at the level and no focal neurologic compromise is evident.    Ç†  C3-4: At C3-C4, there is marked disc space narrowing with anterior osteophytes and small uncovertebral osteophytes. There is   moderate left facet degeneration and mild right facet degeneration. This is associated with a degenerative spondylolisthesis of C3  on C4 with 3 mm of anterior motion. No significant central stenosis is present and the level and the foramina are still preserved   bilaterally.    Ç†  C4-5: At C4-C5, there is marked narrowing of the disc space. Both anterior and bilateral uncovertebral osteophytosis is present   and a minor concentric bulge is posterior osteophytes are noted. Intervertebral foramina are widely preserved. Narrowing of the   central canal to and AP diameter of 7-8 mm is noted and slight flattening of the cord is noted at the level. There is foraminal   narrowing bilaterally at the level which I believe to be moderate in severity.    Ç†  C5-6: At C5-C6, there is moderate to marked disc space narrowing. Small posterior and bilateral uncovertebral osteophytes are   present in the uncovertebral osteophytes are little more pronounced on the left than they are on the right. Intervertebral   foramina are preserved. Narrowing of the AP diameter of the canal to 6 mm is noted. Flattening of the cord is noted at the level.   Mild narrowing of the left intervertebral foramen is noted while the right-sided foramen is widely patent.    Ç†  C6-7: At C6-C7 there is moderate to marked disc space narrowing and again there is anterior and bilateral uncovertebral   osteophytosis as well as small posterior osteophytes and a minor concentric bulge. The appearances are associated with mild   narrowing of the AP diameter of the canal to 8 mm. No significant foraminal narrowing is present at the level.    Ç†  C7-T1: At C7-T1, disc height is reasonably maintained. Minor concentric disc bulge is present. There is moderate left facet   disease and minor right facet disease at the level. No focal neurologic compromise is identified.    Ç†  The signal intensity of the cervical spinal cord is normal along its length without evidence of compressive myelomalacia.    Ç†  IMPRESSION:    Ç†  Grade 1 spondylolisthesis of C3 on C4 is result of bilateral facet degeneration. Spinal stenosis is seen from C4-C5 through the   C6-C7 level. The stenosis is most pronounced at C5-C6 where the AP diameter of the canal is reduced to 6 mm and flattening of the   cord is noted at the level.    Ç†  Intermittent foraminal narrowing is seen along the length of the cervical spine. Foraminal narrowing appears most pronounced at   C4-C5 where believe there is moderate bilateral foraminal narrowing.    Ç†  Ç†  No evidence of compressive myelomalacia."
1092,0,"MR LUMBAR SPINE  HISTORY: No history provided on requisition.  Technologist obtained history - Right-sided radiculopathy symptoms since February 5, 2020.  TECHNIQUE: Routine MRI lumbar spine (sagittal T2, sagittal T1, sagittal STIR, axial T2/T1).  COMPARISON: Radiograph January 27, 2020.  FINDINGS: 5 lumbar-type vertebral bodies are assumed. The vertebral body heights are maintained.  Conus medullaris terminates approximately at L1, within normal limits. Abnormal marrow signal.  Heterogeneous patchy decreased T1/T2 signal is seen throughout the spine. No acute compression  fracture is identified.  Multilevel disc desiccation, extending from L1 to S1.  T12-L1: No spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis.  L1-L2: There is mild circumferential disc bulging. There is no spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis.  L2-L3: No spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis.  L3-L4: There is mild circumferential disc bulging. There is no spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis.  Minor facet arthropathy.  L4-L5: Broad based circumferential disc bulging. A small right superimposed lateral recess/foraminal zone  disc extrusion is noted. The extruded disc material contacts the traversing right L5 nerve root within the  lateral recess, with possible impingement in region of the ligamentum flavum.  Disc material also possibly contacts the traversing left L5 nerve root, without evidence of impingement.    There is mild ligamentum flavum hypertrophy and mild facet arthropathy. No significant spinal canal  stenosis. Mild right neural foraminal narrowing. Left neural foramen is patent.  L5-S1: Severe disc space narrowing. Small broad based disc osteophyte complex which abuts the ventral  thecal sac. No significant resultant spinal canal stenosis. Mild bilateral facet arthropathy. Mild-moderate  right and mild-moderate left neural foraminal stenosis.  There is a T1 hyperintense-T2 hypointense triangular shaped focus along the posterolateral aspect of the  midpole right kidney measuring approximately 1.4 x 1.4 cm (TR/AP). This could represent a focus of  cortical scarring.  IMPRESSION:  1. At L4-L5, broad based disc bulging with superimposed small right paracentral disc protrusion which  results in narrowing of the right lateral recess. Disc material contacts and possibly impinges the traversing  right L5 nerve root in the lateral recess, near region of the ligamentum flavum.  2. At L5-S1, severe degenerative disc disease with no significant spinal canal stenosis. Mild-to-moderate  bilateral neural foraminal stenosis.  3. No severe spinal canal stenosis in the lumbar spine.  4. Abnormal marrow signal. There is heterogeneous diffuse replacement of normal fatty marrow signal.  Findings are not entirely specific and may be secondary to a number of different etiologies including  leukemia/lymphoma, myeloma, or diffuse metastases. Review of Netcare notes that a flow cytometry  performed on October 19, 2017 demonstrates findings consistent with T-cell large granular lymphocytic  leukemia. Findings, thus, can be secondary to leukemia. Clinical correlation is advised.  5. There is a small T1 hyperintense/T2 hypointense focus along the posterolateral aspect of the midpole right kidney. Differential considerations include a hemorrhagic/proteinaceous cyst, or possibly a focus of cortical scarring. This is, however, incompletely characterized."
1093,1,"FINDINGS: Minimal likely fibronodular changes at the lung apices.  Limited assessment of the imaged portions of the intracranial structures appear unremarkable.  A few small T2 hyperintense likely cystic areas are noted within the region of the nasopharynx, the largest  measuring up to 5 mm, the overall appearance is similar when compared to previous and favored to be  related to mucus retention cysts.  Increased T2 hyperintensity within the spinal cord at the T4-T5 level, findings favored to be related to  minimal hydrosyringomyelia measuring up to 1 mm in thickness and slightly more conspicuous when  compared to the prior examination.  Mild degenerative disc disease of the cervical spine, most severe from C4 until C7.  Minimal type 2 Modic changes at the endplates of the cervical spine, favored to be relatedto  degenerative changes.  Axial images were obtained from C2 until superior T6 vertebral body level. On a level-by-level basis:  C2-C3: Mild posterior disc osteophyte complex indenting the anterior thecal sac without significant  central canal stenosis. No significant foraminal stenosis.  C3-C4: Posterior disc osteophyte complex indenting the anterior thecal sac and spinal cord without  significant central canal stenosis. Minimal right uncovertebral joint arthrosis.

C5-C6: Posterior disc osteophyte complex indenting the anterior thecal sac and spinal cord with mild to  moderate central canal stenosis, overall mildly worsened when compared to previous. Bilateral facet  arthropathy and uncovertebral joint arthrosis resulting in moderate to severe bilateral foraminal stenosis.  C6-C7: Posterior disc osteophyte complex indenting the anterior thecal sac with no significant central  canal stenosis. Left greater than right uncovertebral joint arthrosis resulting in moderate to severe left and  mild right foraminal stenosis, overall findings at this level are similar to marginally worsened when  compared to previous.

Mild to moderate spondylotic changes of the cervical spine, similar to marginally worsened when  compared to previous and most severe at the C5-C6 level where there is mild to moderate central canal  stenosis and moderate to severe bilateral foraminal stenosis. Multilevel changes as described above.  2. Minimal hydrosyringomyelia suspected at the T4-T5 level measuring up to 1 mm in thickness, appears  marginally more conspicuous when compared to previous, nonspecific, could be related to multiple  etiologies including congenital, posttraumatic, secondary to degenerative changes among other  considerations.  3. Findings favored to be related to mucus retention cysts within the nasopharynx, the appearance is similar when compared to previous.  Additional findings as detailed above.  The Workers' Compensation Board has requested that we provide a professional opinion as to whether  the imaging findings are related in whole or in part to the injury in question. This is not considered part of  the official diagnostic imaging report, and will only be used to help a WCB caseworker decide whether  the injury is work-related or not. My opinion is:  Some of the imaging findings could be related to the patient's injury."

1095,0,TECHNIQUE: Routine lumbar spine protocol.  †  FINDINGS:  5 lumbar type vertebra are assumed to be present.  Based on this the conus ends at the T12-L1 disc level and is unremarkable.  †  Axial and sagittal imaging is performed from T12-L1 through to L5-S1.  †  T12-L1: Intervertebral disc is dehydrated with mild loss of disc height.  There is minimal posterior midline disc bulging with minor indentation of thecal sac.  The neuroforamina remain patent.  Canal remains capacious.  †  L1-2: Intervertebral disc is dehydrated.  Some subtle posterior disc bulging with no significant compromise of canal.  Neuroforamina remain patent.  †  L2-3: Intervertebral disc is dehydrated.  Mild left-sided disc bulging with some mild encroachment inferior aspect of the left neural foramen.  The exiting nerve root is not impinged.  The right neural foramen is unremarkable.  †  L3-4: Intervertebral disc is dehydrated.  Minimal left-sided disc bulging with no significant compromise of the neural foramen.  Right neural foramen is unremarkable.  †  L4-5: Intervertebral disc is dehydrated.  Minimal posterior disc bulging with only minor ventral indentation of thecal sac.  †  There is bilateral facet joint osteoarthritis with facet hypertrophy.  Joint effusions are present.  There is also ligamentum flavum thickening.  Arising from the right facet joint there is a small 3 mm synovial cyst.  The combination with mild bulging and the facet overgrowth and ligamentum flavum thickening and small right-sided synovial cyst results in impingement on the thecal sac with some mild narrowing of lateral recesses.  There is mild impingement of the descending right L5 nerve root.  †  L5-S1: Intervertebral disc is dehydrated with moderate loss of disc height.  Anterior vertebral osteophyte formation.  There is mild posterior generalized disc bulging.  This does not result in any compromise of the thecal sac but there is some mild encroachment into inferior aspects off the neural foramina bilaterally.  On the right side the exiting L5 nerve root appears to contact the disc and osteophyte margin.  On the left side there appears to be a thin fat plane maintained.  †  The vertebral body alignment is normal.  The vertebral body heights are maintained.  There is generalized mild to moderate fatty atrophy of the erector spinae musculature.  †  SUMMARY:  †  Multiple level degenerative disc disease as described.  Facet joint osteoarthritis at L4-5.  †  The most significant level appears to be at L4-5 where there is moderate narrowing of the canal diameter.  Mild impingement of the descending right L5 nerve root.  The right L5 nerve root also appears to contact the disc margin as it exits at the L5-S1 neural foramen.  This has potential for symptomatology.

Vertebral body heights are preserved. There are multilevel mild to moderate   degenerative endplate changes with loss of intervertebral disc heights in association. Scattered vertebral body hemangiomata   noted.    †  At T9/10, there is a focal partially calcified posterior disc extrusion measuring 8 mm AP and up to 15 mm transverse. Extruded   disc material measures 13 mm in total craniocaudal dimension, extending approximately 5 mm superior to the inferior T9 endplate   and approximately 4 mm inferior to the superior T10 endplate. This causes posterior displacement and anterior   flattening/indentation of the spinal cord with subtle increased intrasubstance cord T2 signal at this level. The central canal   measures 6 mm AP at the level of the extrusion.    †  There are further shallower posterior disc protrusions seen elsewhere within the thoracic spine. At T5/6, there is a right   parasagittal broad-based disc protrusion which just indents the right anterolateral margin of the cord and causes mild leftward   deviation of the cord without any convincing intrinsic cord signal abnormality at this level. This disc protrusion measures 8 mm   AP and extends superior to the inferior T5 endplate by approximately 6 mm.

Sagittal imaging of L1-2 and L2-3 demonstrates disc hydration within normal limits. No  significant posterior disc bulging or protrusion. Neuroforamina remain patent.  Axial and sagittal imaging is performed from L3-4 through to L5-S1.  L3-4: No significant posterior disc bulging or protrusion. Neuroforamina remain patent.  Disc hydration is within normal limits.  L4-5: Intervertebral disc demonstrates moderate dehydration. There is mild broadbased  left-sided disc bulging along with a small extrusion component in the left neural  foramen. This touches the exiting left L4 nerve root.  On the right lateral aspect there is mild disc bulging which encroaches into inferior  aspects off the neural foramen. The exiting nerve root does not appear compressed.  L5-S1: There is moderate dehydration of intervertebral disc. Mild parasagittal disc  bulging which comes into close proximity to the traversing right L5 nerve root.  Tiny posterior midline disc protrusion with a small peripheral annular tear. This does  not cause any compromise of the thecal sac.  Left neural foramen is unremarkable.  Facet joints appear unremarkable.  The vertebral alignment is normal. Vertebral body heights are maintained.  There is generalized decreased T1 signal which could be due to marrow conversion.  SUMMARY:  Disc degeneration at L4-5 and L5-S1.  At L4-5 there is a small left sided disc bulge with a small extrusion component which  appears to touch the exiting left L4 nerve root. This may potentially give rise to leftsided  thigh pain.

FINDINGS:      Reversal of the normal cervical lordosis is present centered at the C4/5 level. Fairly advanced vertebral body height loss is present at the C4 level along with moderate vertebral body height loss at the C3 and C5 levels and mild vertebral body height loss at the C6 level, all of which appear chronic. Otherwise, to the extent visualized, the vertebral body heights are well-maintained. Mild degenerative change is present involving the predental space. Small anterior osteophytes are present extending from the C3/4 level superiorly down through the C6/7 level inferiorly. The cerebellar tonsils appear normal with respect to position.      At the C2/3 level, the intervertebral disc is unremarkable. The neural foramina appear patent.      At the C3/4 level, fairly prominent degenerative endplate changes are present. Degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints which results in an anterolisthesis of the body of C3 with respect to the body of C4 which measures approximately 5 to 6 mm with associated uncovering of the posterior aspect of the intervertebral disc. Disc/osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline which along with hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum results in mild compression of the adjacent thecal sac/spinal cord. Subtle focal abnormal increased T2 signal is present within the adjacent spinal cord compatible with edematous change. Degenerative change is present involving the uncovertebral joint bilaterally. The findings are resulting in fairly advanced neural foraminal compromise bilaterally.      At the C4/5 level, degenerative endplate changes are present along with moderate narrowing of the intervertebral disc. Degenerative change is present involving the facet joints which results in an anterolisthesis of the body of C4 with respect to the body of C5 measuring approximately 3 mm with associated uncovering of the posterior aspect of the intervertebral disc. A tiny disc protrusion is present posteriorly, straddling the midline but slightly more prominent to the left of midline, which appears to abut but not significantly compress the ventral surface of the adjacent spinal cord. Degenerative changes are present involving the uncovertebral joint bilaterally. The findings are resulting in moderate compromise of the left neural foramen and mild compromise of the right neural foramen.      At the C5/6 level, degenerative endplate changes are present along with moderate to advanced narrowing of the intervertebral disc. A small amount of vacuum phenomenon is suspected within the intervertebral disc. Degenerative change is present involving the facet joints which appears to result in a subtle retrolisthesis of the body of C5 with respect to the body of C6 which measures approximately 2 mm. Disc/osteophyte complex is present posteriorly, straddling the midline, which narrows the ventral subarachnoid space. Degenerative change is present involving the uncovertebral joint bilaterally, more prominent on the right side. The findings are resulting in severe compromise of the right neural foramen and at least moderate compromise of the left neural foramen.      At the C6/7 level, degenerative endplate changes are present along with moderate-to-advanced narrowing of the intervertebral disc. Mild disc/osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline, which narrows the ventral subarachnoid space. Degenerative changes are present involving the uncovertebral and facet joints bilaterally, more prominent on the right side. The findings are resulting in moderate compromise of the right neural foramen and mild compromise of the left neural foramen.      At the C7/T1 level, subtle degenerative endplate changes are present. Mild degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints. The findings are resulting in minimal compromise of the left neural foramen. The right neural foramen is patent.      The remainder of the visualized levels are unremarkable.      To the extent visualized, the soft tissues of the neck are unremarkable. Patchy abnormal increased T2 signal is present centrally within the pons which is nonspecific but may simply reflect small-vessel ischemic changes, especially if the patient has a history of hypertension and/or diabetes.      IMPRESSION:      Vertebral body height loss is present at the C3, C4, C5, and C6 levels, with associated kyphotic deformity. Superimposed degenerative change is present involving the intervertebral disc as well as the uncovertebral and facet joints, resulting in neural foraminal compromise at multiple levels (most striking bilaterally at the C3/4 level) as well as at least mild compression of the thecal sac/spinal cord at the C3/4 level as discussed. Additionally, subtle focal abnormal increased T2 signal is present within the spinal cord at the C3/4 level compatible with edematous change. A fairly urgent surgical consultation is advised."

1155,0,"MR spine technique: Sagittal T1 and STIR of the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine.      COMPARISON: MR lumbar spine 24 August, 2019.      FINDINGS:   Counting from C2 down there is normal segmentation with 5 mobile type lumbar vertebral bodies.      MR from August 2019 demonstrated compression fracture of the inferior L3 and superior L4 endplates with edema is present through the L4 vertebral body. This edema has resolved with no significant residual edema within the L3 or L3-4 vertebral bodies.      Remote compression fracture of the T12 vertebral body is unchanged from August 2019.      Degenerative changes of the cervical spine with reversal of lordosis at C3-C6. Some C4-C5 disc osteophyte slightly indenting the cord and flavum hypertrophy at C5-C6 indenting the cord. No definite compression of the cord and cord signal intensities appear normal.

1156,0,"MRI lumbar spine      History: LONG STANDING MID AND LOWER BACKPAIN, ASSOCIATED WITH NUMBESS, TINGLING ALL THE XRAY TO BOTH LEGS.     Technique: Sagittal and transverse T1 and T2     FINDINGS:  The radiographs of December 8, 2016 show 5 lumbar type vertebrae. As on those films there is normal alignment with no anterolisthesis. The vertebral body heights are preserved. Multiple Schmorl nodes are present. Multilevel disc height loss, desiccation and posterior bulge are present. There are annular tears at L4-5, L3-4, and T12-L1 as seen on November 24, 2017. The conus is at L1 to. The filum terminalis is not fatty. As noted in 2017 the spinal canal is slightly developmentally narrow diffusely.     L5-S1: Prominent left and mild right facet hypertrophy, with disc bulge eccentric to the right and bulky endplate osteophytes. There is left foraminal encroachment. Epidural fat narrows the spinal canal mildly. Appearance is similar to 2017.     L4-5: Prominent bilateral facet hypertrophy with increased osteophyte formation posteriorly since 2017. Prominent epidural sat is again seen. Concentric disc bulge, facet hypertrophy and epidural fat narrows the spinal canal with crowding of nerve roots but CSF is not fully effaced. Left foraminal encroachment. Findings remain similar to 2017.     L3-4: Facet hypertrophy, disc bulge, epidural fat proud to the nerve roots in spinal canal without full effacement of CSF. There is left foraminal stenosis and right foraminal encroachment. Similar to 2017.     L2-3: Mild facet hypertrophy and disc bulge, no stenosis.  L1-2: Mild facet hypertrophy and disc bulge, no stenosis.     OPINION:  Multilevel degenerative changes, most prominently exuberant and progressive bilateral L4-5 facet hypertrophy. Facet steroid injection might be of value.  Chronic spinal canal narrowing from L3-4 to L5-S1 partially contributed to by epidural lipomatosis. This does not quite meet criteria for central spinal stenosis.  Chronic multilevel left-sided foraminal narrowing, with frank stenosis at L3-4."

1158,0,"CLINICAL HISTORY: Worsening radiculopathy type pain radiating from left neck to left shoulder and arm, with numbness and tingling weakness.      TECHNIQUE: MRI of the cervical spine was performed with sagittal T1 and T2 sequences through the entire cervical spine as well as axial medic 3-D T2 sequences from C2-C3 to C7-T1.      COMPARISON: No relevant prior MRI. Radiographs of the cervical spine from 11 May, 2020.      FINDINGS:      Normal curvature and alignment of the cervical spine. Vertebral bodies are normal in height without evidence of fracture. No significant bone marrow signal abnormality.      There is an intramedullary cervical cord lesion at the level of C2 to the left of midline anterolaterally, measuring approximately 4 x 4 x 5 mm (AP x TR x CC). This lesion is occult on T1 weighted sequences, demonstrating isointense to mildly increased T2 signal intensity centrally compared to adjacent cord, with surrounding peripheral T2 hypointense rim. The T2 hypointense rim is even darker on axial T2 medic sequences.      No additional spinal cord lesion identified within the cervical and visualized upper thoracic cord. No hydrosyringomyelia.      Prevertebral cervical and paraspinal soft tissues are within normal limits. Visualized intracranial contents, posterior fossa and craniocervical junction are unremarkable.      Degenerative disease:      Atlantoaxial and atlantooccipital joints are intact without significant degenerative change. At C2-3, C6-7, and C7-T1 there is no large disc bulge or protrusion. No significant spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis at these levels. Vertebral bodies and intervertebral disc spaces of the visualized upper thoracic spine are unremarkable.      At C3-4, small posterior disc osteophyte complex and uncovertebral hypertrophy effaces the ventral CSF space and results in mild narrowing of the spinal canal. Minimal bilateral facet degeneration. No neural foraminal stenosis.      At C4-5, minor posterior disc osteophyte complex and uncovertebral hypertrophy results in mild spinal canal stenosis. Minimal bilateral facet degeneration. No neural foraminal stenosis.      At C5-6, large left paracentral and medial foraminal soft disc protrusion severely narrows the left lateral recess and neural foramina, and may contact the exiting left C5 nerve root. Mild spinal canal stenosis. Minimal bilateral facet degeneration.      IMPRESSION:      Tiny solitary intramedullary cervical cord lesion to the left of midline anterolaterally at C2, demonstrating signal characteristics typical of cavernous malformation. Attempt will be made to have the patient recalled for gadolinium enhanced MRI of the cervical spine to exclude the low likelihood of enhancement.      Large left paracentral and medial foraminal disc protrusion at C5-6 severely narrows the left lateral recess and neural foramina, and may compress the exiting left C6 nerve root."
