18,0,"Narrative & Impression  MR LUMBAR SPINE      Reason for Exam: PATIENT HAS BACK PAIN THAT RADIATES DOWN BACK OF LEFT LOWER LEG. MISSING KNEE REFLEX ON LEFT. QUERY LEFT-SIDED SCIATICA.     HISTORY:  As above.     TECHNIQUE:  Standard radiculopathy protocol, consisting of sagittal T1 and T2 imaging from T11-12 to the mid sacrum and axial T1 and T2 imaging from L3-4 to L5-S1.     FINDINGS:  Comparison made to the MR lumbar spine from January 28, 2015 (Royal Alexandra Hospital) and lumbar spine x-rays from October 11, 2018 (Insight Medical Imaging).     Five lumbar vertebrae are assumed. Similar minimal curvature of the lumbar spine convex left. Vertebral body heights are maintained. Similar mild degenerative endplate changes noted ventrally at the L2-3 level, associated with small osteophytes. No marrow abnormalities of concern in the remainder of the spine.     Conus medullaris is normal, terminating at the L1 level.     No significant disc bulging or herniation noted at the T11-12, T12-L1 or L1-2 levels.     At L2-3, there is a small annular disc bulge indenting the thecal sac but not causing any nerve root impingement. Slight narrowing of both neural foramina but no impingement of the exiting L2 nerve roots. No spinal stenosis.     At L3-4, disc height is maintained. A small annular disc bulge is present, mildly indenting the thecal sac and slightly encroaching upon the inferior aspect of both neural foramina, but not causing any focal nerve root impingement. No significant facet degenerative changes. No spinal stenosis or lateral recess stenosis.     At L4-5, disc height is maintained. Mild annular disc bulging is present, resulting in slight encroachment upon the inferior aspect of both neural foramina but no impingement of the exiting L4 nerve roots. Mild bilateral facet degenerative changes. No spinal stenosis or lateral recess narrowing.     At L5-S1, there is slight loss of disc height with diffuse hypointense T2 disc signal indicative of disc degeneration. A small shallow central disc-osteophyte complex abuts the thecal sac. The small posterolateral disc extrusion situated paracentrally on the left, protruding inferiorly, demonstrated on the previous MR study, has almost completely resolved. A tiny residual/recurrent left posterolateral disc protrusion remains, indenting but not displacing the descending left S1 nerve root. The left S2 nerve root is no longer compressed. Similar mild stenosis of the left neural foramen. Right neural foramen remains of reasonable caliber. Similar mild degenerative changes of both facet joints. No spinal stenosis.     Visualized sacroiliac joints are unremarkable. Prevertebral soft tissues are unremarkable.     OPINION:  Previously demonstrated left-sided disc extrusion/sequestration at L5-S1 is no longer evident.

An exaggeration of the thoracic kyphosis centered at T8 / 9 is also similar to the prior CT study. There is otherwise normal alignment of the vertebral bodies and facet joints. On the localizer images, prominent T2 hyperintensity within the L5 vertebral body may relate to an underlying hemangioma. Small superior Schmorl ' s nodes are also noted at L5 and S1. Focal ventral chromatic_aberrations of the thoracic Lisfranc_joint cord is noted at the level of T8, abutting the T8 vertebral body. The posterior aspect of the thoracic spinal cord at the level of T8 has a focally angulated appearance. Abnormal T2 hyperintensity is noted within the thoracic spinal cord at the level of T8 extending to the level of T9. Hypertrophic degenerative facet arthropathy is contributing to mild neural foraminal narrowing at T11 / 12. No other significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing throughout the thoracic spine. IMPRESSION: Appearances are compatible with a spinal cord herniation at the level of T8. Abnormal T2 hyperintense signal within the thoracic spinal cord at T8 / 9 is optimized with cord edema / myelomalacia.

L  -L4, 2009     An MRI of the lumbar spine performed 19 September, 2014 is available for comparison.     A clinical history of ""severe spinal stenosis for possible surgery"" has been provided.     TECHNICAL:     Sagittal and axial T1- and T2-weighted sequences were performed.     FINDINGS:     This report assumes five lumbar-type vertebrae. A subtle curvature is present convex to the right which may in part be related to patient positioning. The vertebral body heights are relatively well-maintained allowing for Schmorl's node formation associated with the endplates throughout the lumbar region and are stable in appearance when compared with the prior study performed in September of 2014. The bone marrow signal is fairly homogeneous allowing for hemangiomata/fatty rests as well as degenerative endplate changes at several levels. There is evidence for a prior posterior decompression procedure at the L4 level with associated postoperative changes within the overlying soft tissues posterior to the osseous spinal column. The conus medullaris terminates normally at approximately the L1 level.     At the S1/2 level, an underdeveloped disc is noted. No significant neural foraminal compromise or compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.     At the L5/S1 level, a prominent anterior osteophyte is noted straddling the midline. Moderate degenerative endplate changes are present along with moderate-to-advanced narrowing of the intervertebral disc. A trace amount of vacuum phenomenon is suspected within the intervertebral disc. Disc/osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline which extends laterally protruding into the inferior aspect of the neural foramen bilaterally. A minuscule focus of abnormal increased T2 signal is present within the disc annulus posteriorly to the right of midline, compatible with an annular fissure. Degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints, mild-to-moderate on the left and mild on the right. The findings are resulting in moderate-to-severe compromise of the right neural foramen and moderate compromise of the left neural foramen. No significant compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.     At the L4/5 level, moderate degenerative endplate changes are present, more prominent eccentric to the left. Narrowing of the intervertebral disc is present, fairly advanced on the left and moderate on the right. Disc/osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline which extends laterally protruding into the inferior aspect of the neural foramen bilaterally. The posterior disc/osteophyte complex appears to involve the traversing L5 nerve root bilaterally, more prominent on the left side. Moderate degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints. There is hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum. The findings are resulting in moderate compromise of the adjacent thecal sac as well as severe compromise of the right neural foramen and moderate inferior neural foraminal compromise on the left. Subtle clumping of the nerve roots is noted within the thecal sac at this level, raising the possibility of arachnoiditis.     At the L3/4 level, moderate degenerative endplate changes are present, more prominent eccentric to the left. Narrowing of the intervertebral disc is present, advanced on the left and moderate-to-advanced on the right. Disc/osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline which extends laterally protruding into the inferior aspect of the neural foramen bilaterally, slightly more striking on the left side. A superimposed small disc extrusion persists posteriorly straddling the midline, but more prominent to the left of midline, which has diminished in size when compared with the prior study and likely involves the traversing L4 nerve root. Mild degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints. The findings are resulting in the severe compromise of the left neural foramen and mild-to-moderate compromise of the right neural foramen as well as minimal/mild compromise of the adjacent thecal sac.     At the L2/3 level, a prominent anterior osteophyte is noted straddling the midline. Moderate degenerative endplate changes are present, more prominent eccentric to the right. Narrowing of the intervertebral disc is present, advanced on the right and moderate on the left. Disc/osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline which extends laterally protruding into the inferior aspect of the neural foramen bilaterally. A minuscule focus of abnormal increased T2 signal is noted within the disc annulus posteriorly, compatible with an annular fissure. The posterior disc/osteophyte complex appears to contact but not significantly displace the traversing L3 nerve roots. Mild-to-moderate degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints. The findings are resulting in moderate compromise of the left neural foramen and mild compresses of the right neural foramen. No significant compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.     At the L1/2 level, a small anterior osteophyte is noted straddling the midline. Mild degenerative endplate changes are present along with mild-to-moderate narrowing of the intervertebral disc. A minuscule shallow disc protrusion is present posteriorly in the midline which does not appear to involve the traversing L2 nerve roots. Minor disc/osteophyte complex is present laterally protruding into the inferior aspect of the right neural foramen. Mild degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints. The findings are resulting in minimal compromise of the right neural foramen. The left neural foramen is patent and no significant compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.     The remainder of the visualized levels are unremarkable allowing for at least mild degenerative facet joint changes.     Atheromatous irregularity is present throughout the abdominal aorta extending into the iliac arteries bilaterally. Diffuse atrophic change is present involving the posterior paraspinal musculature, most prominent inferior to the L4/5 level. To the extent visualized, the regional soft tissue structures are otherwise unremarkable.     IMPRESSION:     Findings compatible with the prior posterior decompression procedure at the L4 level. Degenerative changes are present involving the intervertebral disc and the facet joints at multiple levels resulting in neural foraminal compromise at several levels as well as moderate compromise of the thecal sac/spinal canal at the L4/5 level, as detailed above. The degenerative disc and facet joint changes as well as the resultant neural foraminal compromise have progressed since the prior study performed 19 September, 2014. The degree of compromise of the thecal sac at the L4/5 level also appears to have slightly progressed when compared with the prior study performed 19 September, 2014.     A disc extrusion persists posteriorly straddling the midline, but more prominent to the left of midline at the L3/L4 level which has diminished in size with less resultant compromise of the adjacent thecal sac when compared with the prior study performed 19 September, 2014.       "

TECHNIQUE: Standard radiculopathy protocol, consisting of sagittal T1 and T2 imaging from T11 - 12 to the mid sacrum and axial T1 and T2 imaging from L1 - 2 to L5 - S1. FINDINGS: Comparison made to the MR lumbar spine from September 24, 2016 (UAH ). Lumbar spine x - rays performed September 9, 2019 (Allin Clinic) were also reviewed. Similar curvature of the lumbar spine convex left, centered at L2 - 3. Vertebral body heights are maintained. Small Schmorl ' s nodes within the endplates in the thoracolumbar spine. Marrow signal is unremarkable. No focal destructive osseous lesions. Hypointense T2 disc signal noted within countless of the discs, reflecting disc degeneration. At T11 - 12, there is moderate loss of disc height. A small disc - osteophyte complex does not affect the conus or spinal_chord roots. No spinal stenosis or neural foraminal stenosis. At T12 - L1, disc height is maintained. A small posterior disc - osteophyte complex does not affect the conus or nerve roots. No spinal stenosis or significant neural foraminal stenosis. At L1 - 2, disc height is maintained. A small annular disc bulge does not cause any nerve root impingement. Slight narrowing of both neural foramina. No spinal stenosis. Minor facet degenerative adjustments. At L2 - 3, disc height is maintained. A small annular disc bulge is present, with superimposed small far lateral disc protrusion on the left, encroaching upon every inferior aspect of the left neural foramen, abutting the exiting left L2 nerve root. Mild bilateral therein_lies degenerative changes. No significant lateral legislature_reconvenes stenosis or spinal stenosis. Mild stenosis of both neural foramina, more pronounced on the left. Appearances are unchanged. At L3 - 4, there is mild loss of disc height eccentrically towards the right. A small posterior disc bulge indents the thecal sac. Mild bilateral facet degenerative changes with mild ligamentum flavum thickening. Slight narrowing of both lateral recesses and mild narrowing of the fielder_Jose_Tabata neural foramen but no significant spinal stenosis. Appearances are not significantly changed. At L4 - 5, there is new mild loss of disc height. New grade I spondylolisthesis of 4 mm noted, secondary to severe left - sided and moderate right - sided facet degeneration. The left - sided facet degeneration appears more severe, with osteophyte protruding anteromedially, encroaching upon the left lateral recess. A new, broad - based left paracentral / posterolateral disc extrusion is present, also encroaching upon the left lateral recess and proximal left neural foramen. As a result, there is now severe stenosis of the left lateral recess with compression of the descending left L5 nerve root. There may be impingement of the exiting left L4 nerve root also. Similar mild narrowing of the right lateral recess. New mild transverse narrowing of the thecal sac. More pronounced narrowing of the left neural foramen, now mild to moderate in severity. No significant stenosis of the right neural foramen. At L5 - S1, there is similar mild loss of disc height. A small shallow disc bulge indents the thecal sac. Bilateral facet degenerative changes of mild to moderate severity. No spinal stenosis, significant lateral recess narrowing nor neural foraminal stenosis. Appearances are not significantly changed. Prevertebral soft tissues and comprehended sacroiliac joints are unremarkable. OPINION: 1. More pronounced disc degeneration at L4 - 5. New grade I spondylolisthesis at this level secondary to underlying bilateral (left greater than right) facet degeneration and hypertrophy. New severe stenosis of the left L4 - 5 lateral recess secondary to a combination of facet degeneration and new left - sided disc extrusion, with resultant compression of the descending left L5 nerve root and possible impingement of the exiting left L4 nerve root. 2.

There is no evidence for Chiari malformation demonstrated. The vertebral artery flow voids are maintained bilaterally. The left vertebral artery is dominant. There is straightening and mild reversal of the cervical lordosis present. The straightening extends from the C1 vertebral body/skull base through to the C6 vertebral body level. Prevertebral and paravertebral soft tissues to the extent visualized are unremarkable. No bulky adenopathy is seen within the neck. Level by level information as follows:     The atlanto-occipital articulations are normally aligned. The atlantodental interval exhibits mild degenerative change. The lateral mass articulation alignment at C1-C2 is preserved. There is evidence of mild degenerative disc disease at C2-3 with loss of disc signal and a tiny central disc protrusion. No significant spinal canal or foraminal stenosis is demonstrated. The facet joints are well maintained.     At C3-4, there is a mild disc bulge with superimposed disc protrusion, similar to the previous examination. This indents the ventral thecal sac resulting in mild contour change of the ventral spinal cord, not significantly changed compared to the previous examination without cord signal change. No foraminal stenosis. Facet joints are unremarkable.     At C4-5, there is degenerative disc disease with loss of intranuclear T2 signal and a tiny central disc protrusion without evidence for spinal canal or foraminal stenosis. The facet joints are unremarkable.     At C5-6, there is a moderate-to-severe degenerative disc disease with diffuse loss of intranuclear T2 signal and a 2 mm retrolisthesis with bilateral uncovertebral joint degenerative changes and mild cord signal change noted within the right lateral hemicord at this level involving the anterior horn gray matter. No abnormal enhancement is seen at this level. The spinal cord is flattened in configuration at this level given a underlying mild-to-moderate spinal canal stenosis. There is severe left and moderate right foraminal stenosis with potential irritation of the exiting C6 nerves bilaterally, left greater than right. Mild bilateral facet arthropathy is noted.     At C6-7, mild-to-moderate degenerative disc disease is present with diffuse loss of intranuclear T2 signal and mild circumferential disc bulge with mild uncovertebral joint degenerative changes bilaterally.

128,0,"TECHNIQUE: A routine lumbar spine protocol is performed.     FINDINGS:     The conus medullaris is appropriately situated at the T12-L1 level. No abnormality of signal or contour is identified within the distal cord or conus. Vertebral alignment is well maintained. Intervertebral disc spaces are well maintained. The intervertebral discs within the lower thoracic and upper lumbar spine as far distally as and including the L3-4 level, there is no disc bulge present. The spinal canal caliber is well maintained. Neural foramina are well maintained. There is no nerve root impingement. Facet joints are unremarkable.     At L4-5 level, there is mild decrease in T2 signal indicating early disc desiccation. There is a broad-based posterior disc protrusion which causes indentation upon the anterior aspect of the thecal sac. There is mild hypertrophy of ligamentum flavum at this level and these features produce mild spinal canal stenosis. In particular, there is some significant narrowing of the lateral recesses, more prominent on the left than on the right. This may cause some impingement upon the traversing L5 nerve roots. The disc bulge at this level produces some mild stenosis of the inferior aspects of the left neural foramen and some moderate stenosis of the right neural foramen in the absence of any nerve root impingement.     At the L5-S1 level, there is decreased T2 signal within the intervertebral disc indicating disc desiccation. There is a small broad-based posterior disc bulge which is slightly more prominent to the right of the midline. The disc bulge contains a tiny annular tear. The disc bulge does not cause any significant spinal stenosis. The neural foramina are mildly narrowed bilaterally in the absence of any direct nerve root impingement. There is some mild degenerative change within the facet joints.     CONCLUSION: There is disc degeneration at the L4-5 and L5-S1 levels. At the L4-5 level, disc bulge produces some narrowing of the spinal canal caliber and in particular, of the lateral recesses. There is potential for impingement upon the bilateral traversing L5 nerve roots. At the L5-S1 level, a small broad-based posterior disc bulge contains a tiny annular tear. There is mild degenerative change within the L5-S1 facet joints.     The Workers' Compensation Board has requested that we provide a professional opinion as to whether the imaging findings are related whole or in part to the injury in question.  This is not considered part of the official diagnostic imaging report, and will only be used to help a WCB caseworker decide whether the injury is work-related or not. My opinion is:     Some of the imaging findings could be related to the patient's injury."

There is mild dextroconvex lumbar curvature.  Vertebral body heights are maintained.  Minimal retrolisthesis of L1 on L2 by 0.3 cm is similar to previous.  No further malalignment is seen.  There is disc desiccation throughout the lower thoracic and lumbar spine with disc space narrowing from L2 to S1 and vacuum phenomenon at a few levels.  There is endplate spurring/osteophytosis at most levels in the lower thoracic and lumbar spine most pronounced on the left at L2-L3 with endplate irregularity and Modic changes greatest from L2 to S1.  A degree of interspinous impingement is present in the lower lumbar spine.  There is a developmentally narrow lumbar spinal canal due to short pedicles.  The conus medullaris is normally positioned at the L1 level.  There is a small central disc protrusion which focally indents the ventral aspect of the thecal sac at T11-T12 and a small right foraminal disc protrusion at T12-L1.  There   are known partially imaged right renal cortical cysts and degenerative change of the partially imaged superior SI joints.     At L1-L2: Annular disc bulging and small disc osteophyte complex which flatten the ventral aspect of the thecal sac.  Schmorl's node in the inferior endplate of L1.  Mild left neural foraminal narrowing.  No significant canal, lateral recess or right neural foraminal narrowing.  At L2-L3: Diffuse disc bulge and disc osteophyte complex asymmetrically larger on the left which indent the ventral aspect of the thecal sac.  Together with mild facet and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy, this results in moderate left and mild right neural foraminal narrowing.  No significant canal or lateral recess narrowing.  At L3-L4: Diffuse disc bulge and disc osteophyte complex asymmetrically larger on the left with superimposed small left paracentral disc protrusion which indent the ventral aspect of the thecal sac.  Together with ligamentum flavum thickening and mild to moderate facet degenerative change, this results in mild right and mild to moderate left neural foraminal narrowing and slight narrowing of the left lateral recess.  No significant canal or right lateral recess narrowing.  At L4-L5: Diffuse disc bulge and disc osteophyte complex with superimposed small right paracentral disc protrusion which indent the ventral aspect of the thecal sac.  Together with ligamentum flavum thickening and moderate to advanced facet degenerative change, this results in severe canal narrowing with effacement of the periradicular CSF, central crowding of the cauda equina nerve roots and reduced AP diameter of the thecal sac which measures 0.5 to 0.6 cm.  There is moderate narrowing of the right lateral recess with the transiting right L5 nerve root interposed between the facet and disc material and moderate left and mild-to-moderate right neural foraminal narrowing.  No significant left lateral recess narrowing.  At L5-S1: Diffuse disc bulge and disc osteophyte complex with superimposed tiny left paracentral disc protrusion which flatten the ventral aspect of the thecal sac.  Together with moderate to advanced facet degenerative change, this results in moderate to severe bilateral neural foraminal narrowing with possible compression of the exiting L5 nerve roots as well as slight narrowing of the right lateral recess.  No significant canal or left lateral recess narrowing.     IMPRESSION: Progression of multilevel degenerative disc disease, endplate degenerative change, facet arthropathy and ligamentum flavum thickening.  The most salient abnormality is the presence of severe multifactorial canal stenosis at L4-L5.  There is also neural foraminal narrowing of varying degrees at several levels as outlined above most pronounced at L5-S1 where there is possible compromise of the exiting L5 nerve roots along with slight narrowing of the left lateral recess at L3-L4, slight narrowing of the right lateral recess at L5-S1 and moderate narrowing of the right lateral recess at L4-L5 with possible irritation or impingement upon the transiting right L5 nerve root.  Other findings as outlined above."

The vertebral body heights are well - maintained and appear unchanged in the interval. The bone marrow signal is fairly homogeneous allowing for degenerative endplate changes at several levels, most notably at the L4 / 5 level and at the L3 / 4 level. The conus medullaris terminates normally at approximately the level of the T12 / L1 intervertebral disk. The a small insubstantial perineural cyst is noted within the sacral spinal canal at the S2 level. ‚ At the S1 / 2 level, an underdeveloped disc is noted.

A pseudoarthrosis with associated degenerative change is present involving the transverse process of L5 with the sacrum on the left side. Mild degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints. No significant neural foraminal compromise or compromise of perhaps adjacent thecal sac is appreciated. ‚ At the L4 / 5 level, a small anterior osteophyte is noted straddling the midline, more prominent to the left of midline. Degenerative endplate changes are present, more prominent eccentric to the left. Narrowing of the intervertebral disc is present, advanced on the left and mild to moderate on the right. A small amount of vacuum phenomenon is present within the intervertebral disc eccentric to the left. Disc / osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline which extends laterally protruding into the inferior aspect of the amygdala foramen bilaterally, more prominent on the left side. The posterior disc / osteophyte complex does not appear to involve the traversing L5 nerve roots. Degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints, moderate on the left and mild on the right. There is borderline hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum. The findings are resulting in moderate compromise of the left neural foramen and minimal / mild compromise of the right neural foramen. No significant compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated. ‚ At the L3 / 4 level, moderate - to - advanced degenerative endplate changes are present along with marked narrowing of the intervertebral disc. Vacuum phenomenon is present within the intervertebral disc. A defect is present within the pars interarticularis bilaterally at the L3 level with an associated anterolisthesis of certainly body of L3 with respect to the body of L4 measuring approximately 8 mm resulting in uncovering of the posterior aspect of the intervertebral disc.

Alignment is normal. Vertebral body heights are maintained. Marrow signal is unremarkable. Mild degenerative changes within the inferior endplate of L5. Prevertebral soft tissues are unremarkable.     Conus medullaris is normal, terminating at the upper L2 level. No fatty filum terminale.     The T11-12, T12-L1, L1-2 and L2-3 discs are unremarkable. No spinal stenosis or neural foraminal stenosis at these levels.     At L3-4, disc height is preserved. Hypointense T2 disc signal reflects disc degeneration. A small shallow central disc protrusion with tiny annular fissure indents the thecal sac. No nerve root impingement, spinal stenosis or neural foraminal stenosis. Facet joints are unremarkable.     At L4-5, disc height is maintained. Diffuse hypointense T2 disc signal noted. A small shallow central disc protrusion mildly indents the ventral thecal sac.

310,0,"Reason for Exam: SHE HAS SPINAL STENOSIS AND RADICULOPATHY. SHE IS KNOWN WITH CP. SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO GO FOR BACK SURGERY IN 2017. BUT SHE GOT SICK. ?SPINAL STENOSIS      HISTORY:  As above.     TECHNIQUE:  Standard radiculopathy protocol, consisting of sagittal T1 and T2 imaging from T9 to the upper sacrum and axial T1 and T2 imaging from L3-4 to L5-S1.     FINDINGS:  Comparison made to the MR lumbar spine from April 26, 2016 (Grey Nuns Hospital). Lumbar spine x-rays performed December 5, 2016 (St. Paul HCC) and CT abdomen/pelvis from August 27, 2018 (Cold Lake HCC) were also reviewed.     Five lumbar vertebrae are assumed. Moderate curvature of the lumbar spine convex right centered at L3-4. Vertebral body heights are maintained. No focal destructive osseous lesions.     The lower thoracic spinal cord and conus medullaris are suboptimally assessed due to motion artifact. They appear grossly normal in caliber. Conus terminates in a normal fashion at the L1 level. No fatty filum terminale.     Hypointense T2 signal noted within most of the lower thoracic and lumbar discs, indicative of underlying disc degeneration.     Similar tiny posterior disc protrusions are present at the T9-10, T10-11 and T11-12 levels, indenting the thecal sac but not affecting the spinal cord or nerve roots. No spinal stenosis or significant neural foraminal narrowing at these levels.     At T12-L1, disc height is preserved. Mild annular disc bulging is present. No nerve root impingement, spinal stenosis or neural foraminal stenosis. Minor facet degenerative changes.     At L1-2, there is similar subtle retrolisthesis of L1 on L2. Mild loss of disc height eccentrically towards the right. A small right paracentral disc-osteophyte complex indents the thecal sac but does not affect the conus. Moderate stenosis of the right neural foramen noted. No stenosis of the left neural foramen. No spinal stenosis. Minor facet degenerative changes. Appearances are not significantly changed.     At L2-3, disc height is reasonably well-maintained. A small broad-based posterior disc-osteophyte complex indents the ventral thecal sac and encroaches upon the inferior aspects of both neural foramina, resulting in bilateral neural foraminal stenoses of mild to moderate severity. Mild to moderate left-sided and minor right-sided facet degenerative changes. Slight narrowing of the left lateral recess. No stenosis of the right lateral recess. No spinal stenosis. Appearances are not significantly changed.     At L3-4, there remains moderate loss of disc height laterally towards the left with associated moderately advanced degenerative endplate changes. Moderate left-sided and mild right-sided facet degenerative changes and mild ligamentum flavum thickening also noted. A small broad-based disc-osteophyte complex indents the ventral thecal sac. Moderate stenosis of the left lateral recess and moderate to severe narrowing of the left neural foramen noted. Minor narrowing of the right neural foramen. Right lateral recess remains normal in caliber. No significant spinal stenosis. Appearances overall are not significantly changed.     At L4-5, disc height is well-maintained. Bilateral moderate to severe facet degenerative changes are present with ligamentum flavum thickening. A small broad-based posterior disc-osteophyte complex indents the ventral thecal sac. A 6 mm circumscribed focus of hyperintense T1 and T2 signal situated along the anteromedial aspect of the right facet joint is unchanged. This corresponds to a either a small focus of ossification or calcified synovial cyst on the CT scan, contributing to moderate to severe right lateral recess stenosis. There is mild transverse narrowing of the thecal sac posteriorly. No significant left lateral recess narrowing. Mild stenoses of both neural foramina. Appearances overall are similar to the prior MR study.     At L5-S1, there is grade 1-2 spondylolisthesis of 6 mm, worse compared to the 2016 study. Disc height is reasonably well-maintained. There is unroofing of the posterior disc margin, with a small shallow disc bulge indenting the ventral thecal sac. There is severe degeneration of the left facet joint, with severe joint space narrowing and adjacent sclerosis and bony overgrowth evident. Moderate degeneration of the right facet joint also noted. Unilateral right-sided spondylolysis of L5 is again evident. Combination of these findings results in bilateral lateral recess stenoses of at least moderate severity and moderate spinal stenosis. There is severe stenosis of the right neural foramen with virtually complete effacement of the perineural fat and compression and flattening of the exiting right L5 nerve root. Moderate to severe stenosis of the left neural foramen also noted.     Mild degenerative changes noted within the visualized sacroiliac joints. Prevertebral soft tissues are unremarkable.     OPINION:  1. Spondylolisthesis of L5 on S1 is slightly worse compared to the 2016 MR examination. Anterolisthesis is secondary to a combination of right L5 spondylolysis and bilateral facet degeneration. Facet degeneration is severe on the left side. There is severe stenosis of the right L5-S1 neural foramen with compression of the exiting right L5 nerve root. Moderate to severe stenosis of the left neural foramen, bilateral lateral recess stenoses of moderate severity and moderate spinal stenosis at this level also.     2. Multilevel degenerative disc disease in the remainder of the spine is of similar severity, as detailed above. Moderate to severe stenosis of the right lateral recess at L4-5 secondary to a combination of disc degeneration, facet degeneration and small focus of ossification (or synovial cyst with peripheral calcification) at the anteromedial aspect of the right facet joint. Spinal stenosis of moderate severity at L4-5 also."

No other significant abnormality of bone marrow signal is seen. ‚ Central canal is reduced in two levels as discussed below. ‚ In T11 - 12, a chronic broad posterior disc - osteophyte complex results in mild central stenosis with some distortion of cord and thecal sac contour.

387,1,"Reason for Exam: RADICULOPATHY, MAINLY C6 AND C7 RT THAN LT, ADVANCED ARTHRITIS, SHOOTING PAIN FROM THE NECK TO ARMS AND LEGS DISC PROBLEM, SPINAL CORD PRESSURE, H / O TBI Technique: Sagittal T1 and T2 and axial T2 - 3 - D medic sequences of the cervical spine were performed. Findings: Compared to plain films dated October 28, 2020. Tthe visualized posterior fossa demonstrates an unremarkable appearance, with normally positioned cerebellar tonsils. The visualized spinal cord underscore a normal appearance with no altered signal or evidence of syrinx. There is 3 mm of anterior subluxation of C3 upon C4. Alignment of the cervical spine is otherwise impressive. Vertebral body marrow signal is diffusely heterogeneous, with advanced degenerative endplate changes at the C3 - 4 level as well as the C6 - 7 level. C2 - 3: Mild disc osteophyte complex causing flattening of anterior thecal sac. Neuroforamen remain patent bilaterally. C3 - 4: Broad - based disc osteophyte complex resulting in moderate spinal canal stenosis with some associated mass effect upon the spinal cord. There is also some subtle increased T2 signal intensity noted within sported_Steeler right posterior aspect of the spinal cord concerning for edema / myelomalacia. Bilateral uncovertebral joint osteophytes result in mild bilateral foraminal stenosis, right greater than left. Crippling disc space narrowing. Bilateral facet joint arthropathy. C4 - 5: Broad - based disc osteophyte complex resulting in mild spinal canal stenosis. Bilateral uncovertebral joint osteophytes result in suspected mild bilateral foraminal stenosis. The left - sided neural foramen is suboptimally assessed due to metallic artifact due to a foreign body within the left - sided paraspinal soft tissues. This was appreciated on the plain Bullet_Ek_Dhamaka of October 28, 2020. Mild disc space narrowing. C5 - 6: Broad - based disc osteophyte complex resulting in moderate spinal canal stenosis. Bilateral uncovertebral joint osteophytes result in moderate right - sided and mild left - sided foraminal stenosis. Moderate disc space narrowing. C6 - 7: Broad - based disc osteophyte complex resulting in mild spinal canal stenosis. Bilateral uncovertebral joint osteophytes result in mild bilateral foraminal pulmonary_vein. Mild disc space narrowing. The imaged upper thoracic cartilages demonstrates additional broad - based disc osteophyte complexes at every level resulting in some mild spinal canal stenosis. Associated foraminal stenosis is noted particularly on the right hand side of a moderate degree at the T1 - 2 level. Impression: Multilevel degenerative changes as described, with moderate right - sided foraminal stenosis noted at the C5 - 6 level, which may result in irritation of the stumbling right C6 nerve root.

391,0,"MRI LUMBAR SPINE  Technique:  Multiplanar multisequence MRI of the lumbosacral spine was performed.  FINDINGS:  The conus medullaris terminates at the L1-2. It is normal. The L1-2 disc space is  normal. The thecal sac, spinal canal and neural foramina are also normal at this level.  A mild degenerative disc bulge is seen at the L2-3 but the thecal sac, spinal canal and  neural foramina are normal.  At L3-4, a moderate degree generalized at degenerative disc bulge is seen. This is  associated with a mild to moderate degree reduction in the height of the disc space and  anterior marginal osteophyte formation. The thecal sac, spinal canal and neural  foramina are normal.  The L4-5 disc is normal. The thecal sac, spinal canal and neural foramina are normal.  There is a mild hypertrophic degenerative osteoarthritic is of bilateral facet joints at this  level.  At L5-S1, at least a moderate degree degenerative disc bulge is seen. Height of the  disc is space is slightly reduced and there is a posterior marginal osteophyte formation  on the left side which is causing narrowing of the inferior portion of the left L5-S1 neural  foramen. I suspect a mild compression of the left L5 nerve root outside the foramen  because of the marginal osteophyte. The right neural foramen and exiting right L5  nerve root are normal. Descending bilateral S1 nerve roots are normal in the lateral  recesses. Facet joints are normal.  OPINION: A moderate degree degenerative disc disease at L3-4 and L5-S1. The disc-osteophyte  formation is more pronounced in the left lateral aspect at the L5-S1 where the left L5  nerve root may be slightly impinged just outside the foramen, if any.

423,1,Reason for Exam: LEFT SIDED SCIATICA WITH PAIN DOWN TO TOES. SOME BOWEL DYSFUNCTION AS WELL. QUERY NERVE ROOT IMPINGEMENT. Technique: Routine lumbar spine protocol is performed. Findings: Lumbar spine radii is normal. Vertebral body heights are maintained. The conus medullaris and cauda equina are normal. At the T12 - L1 level the disc is normal. The thecal sac and exiting nerve roots are complimentary of compression. At the L1 - 2 level there is a small left paracentral disc protrusion Thirdly minimally compresses the anterior aspect of the thecal sac on the left. The exiting and Hormuz_Straits nerve roots are free of compression. At the L2 - 3 level there is some circumferential disc bulging causing minimal compression on the anterior aspect of By_Christine_Fenno thecal sac. The exiting and transiting nerve roots are free of compression. At the L3 - 4 level there is circumferential disc bulging with a small right paracentral disc protrusion. There is minimal compression on the anterior aspect of the thecal sac and some mild lateral recess stenosis is seen. Theres is some mild foraminal encroachment bilaterally but no definite exiting nerve root or transiting nerve root compressions are seen. At the L4 - 5 level there is circumferential disc bulging with a small to moderate posterior midline disc protrusion with moderate severe facet joint osteoarthritis bilaterally. This causes mild central canal stenosis and moderate severe lateral recess stenosis bilaterally. The exiting nerve roots are free of compression. There is severe transiting nerve root compression bilaterally. At the L5 - S1 level there is circumferential disc bulging. There is a 14 x 9 x 12 mm mass identified in the left lateral recess at the level of the L5 vertebral body likely representating extruded disc material however a neurofibroma or other neoplastic lesion would be in the differential diagnosis. This causes moderate compression of the left anterolateral aspect of the thecal sac. It appears to Poorly_formated_references causing severe compression of the exiting left L5 nerve root as it enters the foramina. Transiting nerve roots remain free of compression. The exiting right nerves root is free of compression. There is severe facet joint osteoarthritis noted bilaterally. IMPRESSION: Multilevel degenerative disc changes with facet joint osteoarthritis at several levels. Masslike abnormality in the left lateral recess superior to the L5 - S1 disc space causing severe compression of the exiting left L5 nerve root. This most likely represents extruded disc material however a neoplastic lesion cannot be completely excluded. Importantly investigation with a contrast - enhanced study could be helpful.

A subtle curvature is present convex to the left which may simply be related to patient positioning. The vertebral body heights are well maintained. The bone marrow signal is fairly homogeneous, allowing for hemangiomata/fatty rests as well as relatively mild degenerative endplate changes at several levels. The conus medullaris terminates normally at approximately the level of the T12/L1 intervertebral disc.     At the S1-S2 level, an underdeveloped disc is noted. No significant neural foraminal compromise or compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.     At the L5-S1 level, subtle degenerative endplate changes are present. Minor degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints. No significant neural foraminal compromise or compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.     At the L4-L5 level, mild degenerative endplate changes are present along with at least mild narrowing of the intervertebral disc. Mild circumferential disc bulging is present and relatively mild disc-osteophyte complex is identified laterally protruding into the region of the neural foramen bilaterally, more prominent on the left side. A superimposed tiny disc protrusion/extrusion is present posteriorly to the left of midline which appears to contact the undersurface of the exiting left L4 nerve root and may contact the traversing left L5 nerve root. Degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints, mild on the left and minimal on the right. The findings are resulting in moderate compromise of the left neural foramen and minimal compromise of the right neural foramen.

A tiny broad-based posterior disc bulge is present.  This does not cause any compromise to the spinal canal caliber or to the neural foramina.  Some minor degenerative change is present within the facet joints.     At the L2-3 level there is a small broad-based posterior disc bulge.  This causes some mild indentation on the anterior aspect of the thecal sac but no significant spinal stenosis.  There is some mild degenerative change within the facet joints.  No nerve root impingement is identified at this level.     At the L3-4 level there is severe loss of disc height.  There is uncovering of the posterior aspect of the intervertebral disc accompanied by a small broad-based posterior disc bulge.  There is hypertrophic degenerative change of moderate severity within both facet joints.

FOR DISC HERNIATION FORAMINAL STENOSIS AND NERVE IMPINGEMENT COMPARISON: MRI lumbar spine October 27, 2018 TECHNIQUE: Sagittal axial T1 and T2 the reclining_rear spine FINDINGS: 5 lumbar type vertebra are assumed for the purposes of this report with normal termination of conus medullaris at L1. Alignment and vertebral body heights are within normal limits. Modic type I degenerative signal change is seen within the L2 - L4 vertebra, with disc degeneration at countless levels, similar to slightly increased from 2018. Allowing for presence of this edema no suspicious organs replacing lesions are seen. At T11 - 12 and T12 - L1: Small disc protrusions are seen, with no significant spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis. At L1 - 2: Broad disc bulge results in mild narrowing of the spinal canal, unchanged with no evidence of nerve root impingement. Neural foramina are patent. At dpad - 3: Small broad disc bulge in combination with hypertrophic facet arthropathy results in mild to moderate narrowing of the spinal canal, unchanged. Moderate right and mild left neural foraminal narrowing secondary to facet and endplate osteophyte has slightly increased. At L3 - 4: Small broad disc bulge in combination with hypertrophic facet arthropathy results in mild narrowing of the spinal canal, possibly slightly from October 2018. Severe left neural foraminal narrowing secondary to facet arthropathy and possible foraminal extent of disc appears unchanged. Right neural foramen is patent. At L4 - 5: Small broad disc bulge and mild facet arthropathy. Mild spinal canal narrowing with no evidence of nerve root impingement within the spinal canal. Moderate to severe right and moderate left neural foraminal narrowing secondary to facet arthropathy, possibly some component of endplate osteophyte and disc on the right, similar to previous. At L5 - S1: No significant spinal canal stenosis. Mild left neural foraminal narrowing secondary to facet arthropathy. Limited assessment of the paraspinal soft tissues demonstrates no other significant abnormalities. IMPRESSION: 1. Multilevel degenerative change in the lumbar spine as described above. Mild spinal canal narrowing at L3 - 4 may have slightly increased. Otherwise no new spinal stenosis. 2. Severe left neural foraminal narrowing at L3 - 4 and moderate to severe right neural foraminal narrowing at L4 - 5 is better seen on the current study so allowing for technical factors appears similar.

528,0,Technique: Routine cervical spine protocol is performed along with additional transverse T2-weighted spin-echo sequences.     Findings: Cervical spine alignment is normal. Vertebral body heights and bone marrow signals are normal. Cord signal and morphology is within normal limits.     At the C2-3 level there is some posterior disc bulging but the cord and exiting nerve roots are free of compression.     At the C3-4 level there is some mild posterior disc bulging but the cord and exiting nerve roots are free of compression.     At the C4-5 level there is some posterior disc bulging which narrows the anterior aspect of the thecal sac but the cord and exiting nerve roots are free of compression.     At C5-6 level there is posterior disc bulging with vertebral endplate osteophytic lipping which touches and possibly minimally compresses the cord. There is severe foraminal encroachment bilaterally with bilateral exiting nerve root compressions.     At the C6-7 level there is a small to moderate left paracentral disc protrusion causing minimal compression of the cord on the left. There is moderate severe foraminal encroachment on the left with exiting nerve root compression and moderate foraminal encroachment on the right also with some exiting nerve root compression.     IMPRESSION: Multilevel degenerative disc changes. This appears to be causing some cord compression at C5-6 and C6-7 levels. There is also severe exiting nerve root compression at C5-6 and C6-7 levels.

547,1,Reason for Exam: LEFT SIDED SCIATICA WITH PAIN DOWN TO TOES. SOME BOWEL DYSFUNCTION AS WELL. QUERY NERVE ROOT IMPINGEMENT. Technique: Routine lumbar spine protocol is performed. Findings: Lumbar spine alignment is normal. Vertebral body heights are maintained. The conus medullaris and cauda equina are normal. At the T12 - L1 level the disc is normal. The thecal sac and exiting nerve roots are free of compression. At the L1 - 2 level there is a small left paracentral disc ilium which minimally compresses the anterior aspect of the thecal sac until the left. The exiting and transiting nerve roots are free of compression. At the L2 - Avg. level there is some circumferential disc bulging causing minimal compression on the anterior aspect of the thecal sac. The exiting and transiting nerve roots are free of compression. At the L3 - 4 level there is circumferential disc bulging with a small right paracentral disc protrusion. There is minimal compression on the anterior aspect of the thecal sac and some mild lateral recess stenosis is seen. There is some mild foraminal encroachment bilaterally but no definite exiting nerve goosegrass or transiting nerve root compressions are seen. At the L4 - 5 level there is circumferential disc bulging with a small to moderate posterior midline disc protrusion with moderate severe facet joint osteoarthritis demanded_nonaggression_treaty. This causes mild central canal stenosis and moderate severe lateral recess diameter_stenosis bilaterally. The exiting nerve roots are free of compression. There is severe transiting nerve root compression bilaterally. At the L5 - S1 level there is circumferential disc bulging. There is a 14 x 9 x 12 mm mass identified in the returned lateral recess at the level of the L5 vertebral Sybil_Berndt likely representing extruded disc material however a neurofibroma or other neoplastic lesion would be in the differential diagnosis. This causes moderate compression of the left anterolateral aspect of the thecal sac. It appears to be causing severe compression of the exiting left L5 nerve root as it enters the foramina. Transiting nerve roots remain free of compression. The exiting right nerve root is free of compression. Thereare is severe facet joint osteoarthritis noted bilaterally. IMPRESSION: Multilevel degenerative disc changes with facet joint osteoarthritis at several levels. Masslike abnormality in the left lateral recess superior to the L5 - S1 disc space causing severe compression of the exiting left L5 nerve root. This most likely represents extruded disc material however a neoplastic lesion cannot be completely excluded. Further alleged with a contrast - enhanced study could be helpful.

A MRI from May 2018 performed in brace Columbia is not available for comparison.     FINDINGS:     5 lumbar type vertebral bodies are assumed.  Loss of normal lumbar lordosis with straightening of the lumbar spine.  The lower thoracic and upper lumbar spine is within normal limits for age without significant degenerative changes.  Spinal cord ends at L1.  Spinal canal and neural foramina are patent at these levels.     At L3-4: Moderate to severe endplate degenerative changes and sclerosis with complete loss of normal intervertebral disc space.  Minor grade 1 anterolisthesis of L3 on L4 which is degenerative in nature.  Trivial broad-based posterior disc bulge results in minimal effacement of the thecal sac.  No significant facet or ligamental hypertrophy.  The spinal canal is patent.  Moderate neuroforaminal narrowing bilaterally with relative preservation of the perineural fat and no definite evidence of nerve root compression.     At L4-5: Mild loss of normal intervertebral disc height with complete loss of normal intervertebral disc signal and broad base near circumferential disc bulging.  The posterior disc bulge mildly effaces the cul-de-sac but does not significantly narrow the spinal canal.  There is moderate ligamentum flavum hypertrophy.  No significant facet hypertrophy.  Spinal canal remains patent.  Mild-moderate narrowing of the left more than right neural foraminal canals with relative preservation of the perineural fat.  Possible mild compression of the exiting left L4 nerve root.     At L5-S1: Moderate-severe loss of normal intervertebral disc height with complete loss of normal intervertebral disc signal and a broad base near circumferential disc bulge.  The posterior disc bulge mildly effaces the thecal sac.  Mild facet hypertrophy with moderate ligamentum flavum hypertrophy.  There is mild-moderate narrowing of the neuroforaminal canal at this level, although the central nerve roots remain unimpeded.  Suspect compression of the descending S1 nerve roots within the lateral recesses bilaterally.  At least moderate narrowing of the neuroforaminal canals bilaterally with minor preservation of the perineural fat possible compression of the right more than left exiting L5 nerve roots.     IMPRESSION:     Moderate multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracolumbar spine most notably at L3-S1.  This results in multilevel neuroforaminal narrowing notably at L4-5 and L5-S1 and moderate L5-S1 spinal stenosis with suspected effacement of the descending S1 nerve roots in the lateral recesses at this level.

583,1,"Findings:  ‚   Direct comparison is made with the prior lumbar MRI of 2017.  ‚   Identification of the L5 segment is defined by the location of the iliolumbar ligament.  ‚   A normal conus medullaris terminates at L1 .  ‚   Multilevel spondylosis and moderate-to-severe degenerative disc disease are again seen.  This has progressed in some levels.  ‚   Degenerative bone marrow signal change is evident in multiple levels.  No other significant abnormality of bone marrow signal is seen.  ‚   Central canal is reduced in two levels as discussed below.  ‚   In T11-12, a chronic broad posterior disc-osteophyte complex results in mild central stenosis with some distortion of cord and thecal sac contour.  This may be the etiology of the thoracic myelopathy described on the history for the 2017 MRI request.  However, cord signal remains normal, showing no edema or evidence for myelomalacia.  The mild stenosis appears relatively stable.  ‚   In T12-L1 and in L1-2, minor broad posterior disc bulges are stable, causing no neural compromise.  The facet joints show minor degenerative change without definite osteoarthritis.  ‚   In L2-3, severe disc degeneration has nearly obliterated the intervertebral disc, representing a significant adverse change from 2017 when the disc was near normal.  There is minor retrolisthesis.  A broad posterior disc bulge associated with the disc degeneration is slightly eccentric towards the right side.  There is now mild central stenosis, with slight distortion in the thecal sac contour.  However, no convincing nerve root compromise is seen, as perineural fat is still preserved bilaterally with respect to exiting and descending nerves.  Mild/moderate osteoarthritis of the bilateral facet joints is present.  ‚   Previously seen fluid between spinous processes of L2 and L3 has resolved, leaving advanced degenerative change.  ‚   L3-4 remains stable.  A broad posterior disc bulge slightly indents the ventral thecal sac but does not cause any convincing neural compromise.  Previously suggested mild central stenosis shows no adverse change.  Moderately severe bilateral facet OA is evident.  ‚   L4-5 is stable.  The broad posterior disc bulge indents the ventral thecal sac but does not cause convincing neural compromise.  The previously described mild bilateral foraminal stenosis shows no progression.  Perineural fat is still preserved.  Severe bilateral facet OA is again evident, with minimal degenerative grade 1 anterolisthesis which was previously present.  ‚   L5-S1 is stable.  The minimal broad posterior disc bulge barely touches the thecal sac because of the capacious size of the central canal in this level.  Neural elements remain fully intact with no compromise.  Severe bilateral facet OA is again seen.  ‚   Impression:  ‚   Multilevel degenerative disc disease and spondylosis are again seen.  The only adverse change from 2017 is the development of new severe degenerative disc disease in L2-3 which was previously near normal.  ‚   The above produces a new level of mild central stenosis.  ‚   Prior mild central stenosis in T11-T12 remains stable; while there may still be mild cord compression, the cord does not show any edema or evidence of myelomalacia.  Clinical correlation is required regarding any persistence of the thoracic myelopathy clinically described in 2017.  ‚   Again no other potential neural compromise is seen on this study, and there is no specific site of convincing nerve root compromise.  ‚   Moderate to severe facet OA is present in most levels."

628,0,"MRI OF THE LUMBAR SPINE     HISTORY: Falling from leg weakness. ? Nerve impingement.     TECHNIQUE: Transverse and sagittal images were obtained through the lumbar spine and sacrum.     FINDINGS: There appear to be six lumbar-type vertebrae noted with the transitional L6 vertebra.     Vertebral body heights in the lumbar spine are maintained and bone marrow signals are normal.     The mid to upper sacral region is extremely deformed, likely secondary to radiation osteitis.     At the L3-L4 level, the disc is normal. The thecal sac, exiting, and transiting nerve roots are free of compression.     At the L4-L5 level, the disc is normal. The thecal sac, exiting, and transiting nerve roots are free of compression.     At the L5-L6 level, the disc is normal. The thecal sac, exiting, and transiting nerve roots are free of compression. There is severe facet joint osteoarthritis.     At the transition between the L6 vertebra and the sacrum, there is an old deformed disc. There is some mild foraminal encroachment bilaterally with some mild exiting nerve root compression seen.     The body of the sacrum is markedly deformed and shows some expansion and inhomogeneity of the bone. This appears to be causing significant encroachment of the sacral foramina with probable bilateral exiting nerve root compressions at several levels in the mid to upper sacrum. Multiple perineural root sleeve cysts are identified within the spinal canal, the largest on the right measuring 2.4 cm.     No definite pre-sacral soft tissue masses or fluid collections seen.     IMPRESSION:   The lumbar spine is relatively normal with no significant exiting or transiting nerve root compression seen. Again there is significant expansion of the bone of the sacrum likely due to prior radiation osteitis resulting in bilateral mid and upper sacral foraminal encroachments causing exiting nerve root compressions at several levels.

Sagittal and coronal STIR imaging of the lower lumbar spine and complete sacrum was also acquired.     FINDINGS:  Comparison made to the CTA abdomen/pelvis from May 31, 2017 and CT colonography study from March 30, 2015 (both performed at Sturgeon Hospital). Lumbar spine x-rays from September 9, 2019 (Insight Medical Imaging) were also reviewed.     Five lumbar vertebrae are assumed. Straightening of the lumbar lordosis. Similar mild curvature convex left centered at L4. Vertebral body heights are maintained. Mild degenerative endplate changes at L2-3. Small fatty rests or intraosseous hemangiomas within multiple vertebrae, of doubtful significance.     Conus medullaris to the extent visualized is unremarkable, terminating at the L1 level. No fatty filum terminale.     There is a large, CSF signal intensity, lobulated and septated cystic structure within the sacral spinal canal, extending into the lower lumbar spinal canal up to the inferior L4 level. The lesion has multiple loculations, most, if not all, of which appear to communicate with each other. There is marked expansion of the sacral spinal canal, with prominent scalloping of the posterior margins of the S1, S2 and S3 vertebral bodies. There is marked thinning of the S2 and S3 vertebral bodies in particular. Locules extend into the S2-3 and S3-4 neural foramina, with a small component extending into the right S1-2 neural foramen also. The lumbar canal component of the lesion is situated posterolaterally towards the left, causing expansion of the lumbar spinal canal and remodeling of the posterior elements. The lumbar thecal sac is displaced anterolaterally towards the right. Posterior scalloping of the L2-L5 vertebral bodies noted. All of these findings are not significantly changed from the   prior CT studies, allowing for differences in modality.     Dimensions of this cystic lesion are 2.9 cm AP x 5.8 cm TR x 13.1 cm CC.     At T12-L1, the disc is normal. No spinal stenosis or neural foraminal stenosis.     At L1-2, disc height and signal are reasonably maintained. A small posterior disc bulge indents the ventral thecal sac and slightly encroaches upon the inferior aspect of both neural foramina. No nerve root impingement, spinal stenosis or neural foraminal stenosis.     At L2-3, there is moderate loss of disc height with diffuse hypointense T2 disc signal indicative of disc degeneration. A small broad-based posterior disc bulge indents the ventral thecal sac. No significant neural foraminal narrowing, spinal stenosis or lateral recess stenosis. Minor facet degenerative changes.     At L3-4, disc height is preserved. Subtle T2 hypointense signal reflecting early disc degeneration. A small, shallow posterior disc-osteophyte complex indents the ventral thecal sac but does not cause any nerve root impingement. No spinal stenosis, neural foraminal stenosis or lateral recess narrowing. Minor facet degenerative changes on the right.     At L4-5, disc height is preserved. Diffuse hypointense T2 disc signal indicative of disc degeneration. A small to moderate-sized broad-based posterior disc-osteophyte complex compresses the ventral thecal sac. This abuts but does not displace the descending S1 nerve roots. No significant lateral recess stenosis or superimposed spinal stenosis on a degenerative basis. Slight narrowing of both neural foramina but no impingement of either exiting L4 nerve root. Aforementioned cyst extends into the left lateral recess and compresses the descending left L5 nerve root, displacing it anteromedially.     At L5-S1, disc height is preserved. Diffuse hypointense T2 disc signal. A small broad-based posterior disc-osteophyte complex indents the ventral thecal sac. It slightly encroaches upon the inferior aspect of both neural foramina, resulting in mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing. Mild facet degenerative changes. No evidence of spondylolysis or significant spondylolisthesis. There is thickening or tethering of the ventral thecal sac at the mid S1 level, which may involve the descending left S2 nerve root. Both descending S1 nerve roots are displaced anteriorly by the cystic lesion.     Prevertebral soft tissues and visualized sacroiliac joints are unremarkable.     OPINION:  1. Multilobulated and septated CSF signal intensity cystic lesion consistent with a large expansile Tarlov cyst situated within the sacral spinal canal, extending into the lower lumbar spinal canal. Adjacent bony remodeling implies this is a long-standing lesion. It causes mild compression and displacement of the thecal sac, compressing and displacing the descending L5 and bilateral S1 nerve roots anteriorly. Size and extent of the cyst are not grossly changed going back to the 2015 CT study.     2. Degenerative disc disease from L2-3 to L5-S1. Small posterior disc-osteophyte complexes do not cause any significant nerve root impingement    "

An exaggeration of the thoracic kyphosis centered at T8 / 9 goes also similar to the prior CT study. There is otherwise normal alignment of the vertebral bodies and facet joints. On the localizer images, prominent T2 hyperintensity within the L5 vertebral body may relate to an underlying hemangioma. Small superior Schmorl ' s nodes are also noted at L5 and S1. Focal ventral distortion of the thoracic spinal cord is noted at the level of T8, abutting the T8 vertebral body. The proximal_tibia aspect of the thoracic spinal cord at the level of T8 has a focally angulated appearance.

Reviewed in conjunction with the previous comparable study of May 1, 2018.  Increased BMI.     T11-12 and T12-L1 discs are normal.  Conus terminates at upper L1.     Lumbar intervertebral discs show degrees of degenerative signal loss with osteophytic lipping.  L4-5 and L5-S1 discs show marked narrowing with Modic endplate signal changes.  Since the prior study, there is been progression of degenerative change at L3-4 now with increased Schmorl type herniation of the superior L4 endplate and mild overall loss of height.  Remaining lumbar vertebral body heights are maintained.  Anterolisthesis of the L3 vertebral body and L4 again evident, though increased during the interval now measuring about 9 mm.  Further degrees of degenerative facet joint overgrowth.     L1-2 disc shows mild posterior annular bulging with no focal protrusion.  Canal/foramina remain patent.     L2-3 disc shows more pronounced posterolateral annular bulging with bilateral foraminal components more pronounced on the left.  Epidural fat planes remain visible adjacent both exiting L2 nerve roots.  Central thecal sac remains reasonably patent, with some narrowing of the lateral recess inlets.  Stable appearance during the interval.     Advanced degenerative facet joint overgrowth/flaval hypertrophy impinges the posterolateral thecal sac narrowing the transverse dimension of the canal, such that posterior epidural fat indents the posterior thecal sac.  Uncovering of the annulus with bilateral foraminal components more pronounced on the right.  Increased anterolisthesis.  Severe stenosis of the thecal sac now present, its anteroposterior dimension reduced to about 3 mm in the midline with effacing of CSF and compression of the cauda.  Right L3 neural foramen remain stenotic with marked attenuation of epidural fat adjacent the exiting right L3 nerve root some probable compression of the nerve root.  A thinned epidural fat plane remains visible adjacent the exiting left L3 nerve root.     Persisting broad-based disc osteophyte complex at L4-5 that indents the ventral thecal sac again with bilateral foraminal components.  Bilateral foraminal stenosis, thinned epidural fat planes remaining visible adjacent the exiting L4 nerve roots, more thinned on the left.  Degenerative facet joint overgrowth impinges the posterolateral thecal sac, with some posterior indentation of the posterior thecal sac by the posterior epidural fat.  Constellation of features results in moderate stenosis of the cyst central thecal sac in marked stenosis of the lateral recess inlets.  Anteroposterior dimension of the thecal sac measures about 7 mm in the midline with some attenuation of CSF and crowding of the cauda.     Broad-based disc osteophyte complex at L5-S1 with bilateral foraminal components.  Ventral thecal sac is minimally distorted.  Canal remains patent.  Traversing S1 nerve roots appear reasonably normal and symmetric.  Bilateral L5 neural foraminal stenosis, again with marked attenuation of epidural fat adjacent both exiting L5 nerve roots particularly on the right.  Visualized upper sacral canal/foramina remain patent.     Opinion:     L3 spondylolisthesis has increased somewhat during the interval.  Discopathy/facetopathy at L3-4 now results in severe stenosis of the thecal sac.  Surgical follow-up may be prudent.  Increased Schmorl type herniation of the superior L4 endplate has also occurred during the interval.  Ongoing stenosis of the L3, L4, and L5 neural foramina as detailed."

MRI THORACIC SPINE: Small benign hemangioma is noted within the T6 vertebral body. Mild anterior wedging of the T8, T9, and T10 vertebral bodies is similar to the prior CT study of January 28, 2019. Multilevel endplate degenerative changes with undulation of the endplates within the mid / lower thoracic spine associated with small Schmorl ' s nodes are also again noted. An exaggeration of the thoracic kyphosis centered at T8 / 9 is also similar to the prior CT study. There is otherwise normal alignment of the vertebral bodies and facet joints. On the VOR_DME images, prominent T2 hyperintensity within the L5 vertebral body may relate to an underlying hemangioma. Small superior Schmorl ' s nodes are also noted at L5 and S1. Focal ventral distortion of the thoracic spinal cord is noted at the level of T8, abutting Jeff_Francouer_bounced T8 vertebral body. The posterior aspect of the thoracic spinal cord at the level of T8 has a focally angulated appearance. Abnormal T2 hyperintensity is noted above the thoracic spinal cord at the AJGA_alumni of T8 extending to the highest of T9. Hypertrophic degenerative facet arthropathy is contributing to mild neural foraminal narrowing at T11 / 12. No other significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing throughout the thoracic spine. IMPRESSION: Appearances are compatible with a spinal cord herniation at the level of T8.

It remains normal.     The T12-L1, L1-L2 and L2-L3 discs demonstrate mild generalized bulge.  It seems that the pedicles at the L2-L3 are congenitally short and this is associated with moderately severe thickening of the ligamenta flava and mild hypertrophic degenerative osteoarthritis of facet joints.  As a combination of these changes, at least a moderate or moderate to marked spinal stenosis has occurred at this level.  Degree of the spinal stenosis has increased in the interval.  The spinal canal is normal at the T12-L1 and L1-L2.     At L3-L4, a marked degenerative disc disease is seen.  Bilateral decompression hemilaminectomies have been performed at this level.  The spinal canal demonstrate a normal caliber.  No residual or recurrent stenosis.  Neural foramina are also normal.  There is no appreciable enhancing scar tissue.     At L4-L5, a marked degenerative disc disease is seen.  This is associated with a mild generalized disc bulge and a small broad-based posterior central disc protrusion.  Degree of the disc protrusion, however, has slightly improved.  The ventral thecal sac is slightly compressed and the lateral recesses are also narrowed.  The bulged/protruded disc abuts against the bilateral descending L5 nerve roots in the lateral recesses.

A pseudoarthrosis with associated degenerative change is present involving the transverse process of L5 with the sacrum on the left side. Mild degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints. No significant neural foraminal compromise or compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated. ‚ At the L4 / 5 level, a small anterior osteophyte is noted straddling the midline, more prominent to the left of midline. Degenerative endplate changes are present, more prominent eccentric to the left. Narrowing of the intervertebral disc is present, advanced on the left and mild to moderate on the right. A small amount of vacuum phenomenon is overviewing within the intervertebral disc eccentric to the left. Disc / osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline which extends laterally protruding into the inferior aspect of the neural foramen bilaterally, more prominent on the left side. The posterior disc / osteophyte complex does not appear to involve the traversing L5 nerve roots. Degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints, moderate on the left and mild on the right. There is borderline hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum. The findings are resulting in moderate compromise of the left neural foramen and negligable / mild compromise of the right neural foramen. No significant compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated. ‚ At the L3 / 4 level, moderate - to - advanced degenerative endplate changes are present along with marked narrowing of the intervertebral disc. Vacuum phenomenon is present within the intervertebral disc. A defect is present within the pars interarticularis bilaterally at the L3 level with an associated anterolisthesis of the body of L3 with respect to the body of L4 measuring approximately 8 mm resulting in uncovering of the posterior aspect of the intervertebral disc. Disc / osteophyte complex is present laterally protruding into the region of the neural foramen bilaterally. Mild degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints. The findings are resulting in severe compromise of the right neural foramen and moderate - to - severe compromise of the left neural foramen. No significant compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated. ‚ The remainder of the visualized levels is unremarkable allowing for minor degenerative disc and facet joint changes. ‚ Atheromatous irregularity is present involving the calf_muscle aorta extending into the iliac arteries bilaterally.

761,0,"History:  Lower back pain, radicular symptoms. Has lower legs pain, numbness some  weakness.  Technique:  Standard protocol for lumbar spine.  Findings:  Assuming 5 lumbar vertebrae, normal conus medullaris terminates in L1.  Bone marrow signal and vertebral body height are normal.  Her congenitally short pedicles do predispose to central stenosis.  Variable (mild to moderate) disc degeneration is present in all levels between L2 and  S1.  No significant abnormality is seen above L2. There is no neural compromise.  In L2-3, a broad posterior disc bulge slightly indents the ventral thecal sac but does not  cause neural compromise. Facet joints are normal.  In L3-4, severe bilateral facet OA has resulted in mild (grade 1 or less) anterolisthesis.  The anterolisthesis, her congenitally smaller canal, hypertrophic change from facet joint  and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy all result in moderate/severe central stenosis  whereby the central canal is reduced to a sagittal dimension of barely 5 mm, appearing  to completely efface subarachnoid space at the disc level.  MRI LUMBAR SPINE  There is concurrent severe bilateral lateral recess, which could also compromise  bilateral descending L4 nerves where they exit the thecal sac. Bilateral neuroforamina  remain patent.  In L4-5, severe bilateral facet OA is associated with mild grade 1 degenerative  anterolisthesis. Similar to L3-4 above, constellation of findings result in mild central  stenosis. However, central canal is probably still adequate in this level, with some  preserved subarachnoid space. Neural foramina are patent.  In L5 1, there is severe bilateral facet OA without spondylolisthesis. The disc is actually  normal, and no neural compromise is seen in this level.  Impression:  A constellation of degenerative changes result in severe central stenosis in L3-4 along  with severe stenosis of the bilateral lateral recess. Clinical correlation is required  regarding cauda equina syndrome or L4 radiculopathy.  Mild central stenosis in L4-5 is due to the same Constellation of pathologies. However,  no convincing neural compromise is seen in this level.  There is severe bilateral facet OA in all levels from L3-4 to L5-S1."

An exaggeration of the thoracic kyphosis centered at T8 / 9 is also similar to the prior CT study. There is otherwise normal Ikona_gear of the vertebral bodies and facet joints. On the localizer images, prominent T2 hyperintensity within the L5 vertebral body may relate to an underlying hemangioma. Small superior Schmorl ' s nodes are also noted at L5 and S1. Focal ventral distortion of the thoracic spinal cord knows noted at the level of T8, abutting fromthe T8 vertebral body. The posterior aspect of the thoracic spinal cord at the level of T8 has a focally angulated appearance. Abnormal T2 hyperintensity is noted within the thoracic spinal cord at the level of T8 extending to the level of T9. Hypertrophic degenerative facet arthropathy is contributing to mild neural foraminal narrowing at T11 / 12. No other significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing throughout the thoracic spine. IMPRESSION: Appearances are compatible with a spinal cord herniation at the level of T8.

Vertebral body height appears preserved aside from mild superior endplate compression/degeneration at C6 and to minimal extent suspected at C7 as well.  Background marrow signal is unremarkable.  No convincing signal changes identified within the spinal cord.  No myelomalacia is suspected, but there is some mild compression as discussed below.       Above C4: There is mild disc desiccation but disc height is preserved.  No significant spondylosis is seen in the spinal canal and intervertebral foramina are widely patent.     C4-5: There is disc desiccation with mild anterior disc height loss and endplate degeneration.  No further spondylosis noted.  Spinal canal and intervertebral foramina widely patent.     C5-6: There is moderate degenerative disc disease with height loss and endplate change.  Moderate posterior disc osteophyte complex formation is present and extends to the uncovertebral joints, overall larger on the left side.  This results in mild spinal stenosis with effacement of the CSF in the thecal sac and with mild indentation of the spinal cord, more so on the left.  There is foraminal narrowing from the uncovertebral osteophytes to moderate to severe degree on the left and moderate degree on the right, and this may result in clinically significant exiting C6 nerve root impingement.     C6-7: There is disc desiccation with mild to moderate disc height loss.  Mild endplate degeneration is seen.  Mild posterior central focal disc protrusion is seen and mildly indents the thecal sac.  Moderate uncovertebral osteophytosis is seen bilaterally but is worse on the left.  The left foramen is moderately narrowed in the right foramen is mildly narrowed.  Minimal/mild narrowing of the spinal canal is less pronounced than at the C5-6 level.     C7-T4: There is mild disc desiccation at multiple levels but no significant disc height loss is seen.  Mild calcification of the posterior longitudinal ligament mildly encroaches upon the spinal canal and indents the thecal sac but does not appear to result in significant overall spinal stenosis.  Foramina appear widely patent.     IMPRESSION: There is considerable degenerative spondylosis at the C5-C7 levels, particularly C5-6.  There is associated degenerative disc height loss and endplate change as well as posterior disc bulging and herniation and uncovertebral osteophytosis.  This results in mild spinal stenosis at C5-6 with mild indentation of the spinal cord.  No myelomalacia noted.  Moderate to severe left C5-6 foraminal narrowing is seen, and to lesser moderate degree on the right at C5-6 more than on the left at C6-7.  Mild right C6-7 foraminal narrowing.

FOR DISC HERNIATION FORAMINAL STENOSIS AND NERVE IMPINGEMENT COMPARISON: MRI lumbar spine October 27, 2018 TECHNIQUE: Sagittal axial T1 and T2 the lumbar spine FINDINGS: 5 lumbar type vertebra are assumed for the purposes of this report with normal termination of conus medullaris at L1. Alignment and vertebral body heights are within normal limits. Modic type I degenerative signal change is seen within the L2 - L4 ulna, with Operation_Mindcrime_II degeneration at these levels, similar to slightly increased from 2018. Allowing for presence of this edema no suspicious marrow replacing lesions AI'm seen. At T11 - 12 and T12 - L1: Small disc protrusions are seen, with no significant spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis. At L1 - 2: Broad disc bulge results in mild narrowing of the spinal canal, unchanged with no evidence of nerve root impingement. Neural foramina are patent. At L2 - 3: Small broad disc bulge in combination with hypertrophic facet synovitis results in mild to moderate narrowing of the spinal canal, unchanged. Moderate right and mild left neural foraminal narrowing secondary to facet and endplate osteophyte has slightly increased. At L3 - 4: Small broad disc bulge in combination with hypertrophic facet arthropathy results in mild narrowing of the spinal canal, possibly slightly from October 2018. Severe left neural foraminal narrowing secondary to facet arthropathy and possible foraminal extent of disc appears unchanged. Right neural foramen is patent. At L4 - 5: Small broad disc bulge and mild glaring_deficiency arthropathy. Mild spinal canal narrowing with no evidence of nerve root impingement within the spinal canal. Moderate to severe right and moderate left neural foraminal narrowing secondary to facet arthropathy, possibly some component of endplate osteophyte and disc on the right, sharp_contrast to previous. At L5 - S1: No significant spinal canal stenosis. Mild left neural foraminal narrowing secondary to facet arthropathy. Limited assessment of the paraspinal soft tissues demonstrates no other significant abnormalities. IMPRESSION: 1. Multilevel degenerative change at current lumbar spine although described above. Mild spinal canal narrowing at L3 - 4 may have slightly increased. Otherwise no new spinal stenosis. 2. Severe left neural foraminal narrowing at L3 - 4 and moderate to severe right neural foraminal narrowing at L4 - 5 is better seen on the current study but allowing for technical factors appears similar.

An exaggeration of the thoracic kyphosis centered at T8 / 9 is strongly similar to the prior CT study. There is otherwise normal alignment of the vertebral bodies and facet joints. On the localizer critique@myamericanartist.com, prominent T2 hyperintensity within the L5 vertebral body may relate to an underlying hemangioma.

No spinal stenosis or lateral recess stenosis. Mild narrowing of both neural foramina.     At L3-4, disc height is preserved. A small broad-based disc bulge indents the thecal sac. Mild bilateral facet degenerative change and moderate ligamentum flavum thickening. Combination of these findings results in mild stenoses of both lateral recesses and both neural foramina. No significant spinal stenosis.     At L4-5, there is grade I spondylolisthesis of 5 mm secondary to severe bilateral facet degeneration and moderate ligamentum flavum thickening. Mild loss of disc height with a small shallow posterior disc bulge. Combination of these findings results in mild stenoses of both lateral recesses and mild spinal stenosis. There is a 7 mm T2 hyperintense cyst with thin hypointense rim situated laterally within the right lateral recess, anterior to the right facet joint. This is suspicious for a perineural or synovial cyst. It compresses the exiting right L4 nerve root proximally within the neural foramen. Mild to moderate stenosis of the left neural foramen.     At L5-S1, there is mild loss of disc height.

877,0,"CLINICAL HISTORY: Increased lumbar spine pain. Tenderness and low range of motion. Note is made of recent nuclear medicine white cell scan performed for rule out septic joints with multifocal musculoskeletal pain and increased CRP.     COMPARISON: Nuclear medicine white cell scan completed earlier today, MRI lumbar spine December 29, 2012, radiographs of the lumbar spine August 1, 2018     TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar multi with MRI of the entire spine with and without gadolinium     FINDINGS:  There are 7 cervical, 12 thoracic, and 5 lumbar type vertebra. Conus medullaris is not optimally seen, but appears to terminate around the L1 level.     Mild reversal cervical lordosis and mild anterolisthesis of C3 on C4, favored to be chronic. Moderate left convex curvature of the lumbar spine centered at L4 due to height loss in the right side of the L4 vertebra appears unchanged from April 6, 2020, mildly increased from August 1, 2018. Grade 1 anterolisthesis of L5 on S1 is also unchanged and is associated with bilateral pars intra-articular is defects and severe facet arthropathy on CT.     Cervical:  Marrow signal is diffusely decreased. There is subtle STIR hyperintensity and minor enhancement within the C3-C6 vertebra, with multilevel associated degenerative change. Multiple small disc osteophyte formations are seen in the cervical spine, with no significant spinal canal stenosis. Cervical neural foramina are not well assessed on this study due to technique.     Small (2.1 x 2.7 mm) cystic-appearing focus within the paraspinal musculature to the left of midline the C7-T1 level is nonenhancing and incompletely visualized, presumably just a small incidental cyst. No surrounding enhancement or edema. Visualized posterior fossa structures, cervical spinal cord, and other paraspinal soft tissues are grossly unremarkable.     Thoracic:  No osseous edema or abnormal osseous enhancement in the thoracic spine. No significant spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis is identified in the thoracic region the thoracic spinal cord appears normal in caliber and signal intensity within the limits of this study.      Limited assessment of the thoracic paraspinal soft tissues demonstrates no other significant abnormalities.     Lumbar:  Modic type II degenerative endplate signal change without significant enhancement at the L2-3 level. Mild edema and enhancement of the endplates on either side of the L3-4 disc space. Prominent Schmorl's nodes suspected in the superior endplate of L4. Modic type II degenerative endplate signal change without significant enhancement or edema in the endplates about the L4-5 disc space. Mild edema and enhancement slight endplate irregularity about the L5-S1 disc space. Severe multilevel arthropathy with most prominently on the right at L3-4 through L5-S1 where there is mild osseous edema and enhancement. This most conspicuously involves the right L3-4 facet with some loss of cortex in either side of the joint. There is prominent edema and enhancement within the paraspinal muscles adjacent to these facets. Minimal fluid within the L1-2 through L5-S1 disc spaces.     At T12-L1 and L1-2: Small posterior disc bulges without significant spinal canal stenosis.     At L2-3: Small posterior disc bulge in combination with hypertrophic facet arthropathy mildly narrows the spinal canal. Moderate left and mild right neural foraminal narrowing secondary to facet arthropathy.     At L3-4: Small broad disc bulge and endplate osteophyte and combination with severe right more than left hypertrophic facet arthropathy moderately narrows the central portion the spinal canal. Further enhancing tissue presumably extending from the adjacent facet joint effaces the right neural foramina and subarticular recess, which are both significantly narrow potentially causing impingement upon the right L3 and L4 nerve roots respectively. Moderate to severe left neural foraminal narrowing.     At L4-5: Small broad disc bulge and marked hypertrophic facet arthropathy, narrowing the left more than right subarticular recess but not significantly narrowing the central portion the spinal canal. Severe left and moderate to severe right neural foraminal narrowing secondary to the facet arthropathy. There could also be some distortion of the left L5 nerve root within the subarticular recess.     At L5-S1: Grade 1 anterolisthesis associated bilateral pars interarticularis defects and severe facet arthropathy. There is only mild narrowing of the spinal canal. Severe bilateral neural foraminal narrowing secondary to the facet arthropathy and listhesis.     Limited assessment of the visualized paraspinal soft tissues demonstrates no additional significant abnormalities.     IMPRESSION:  1.  Complex study revealing no convincing single focal source of infection arising from the spine. Advanced degenerative change in the lumbar spine. Mild enhancement within the C3-C6 vertebra, within the endplates on either side of the L1-2, L3-4, and L5-S1 disc spaces, and in the right L3-4 through L5-S1 facets could largely reflect changes of active arthropathy. However, a low-grade or multifocal infection particularly at the lumbar sites of enhancement would be difficult to exclude on MRI. The most prominent finding is cortical irregularity and significant adjacent soft tissue and epidural enhancement surrounding the right L3-4 facet joint, which could reflect infection but is of less certain significance given extent of findings elsewhere.     2.  Multilevel degenerative change in the lumbar spine as detailed. As described there potential nerve root impingement in the spinal canal at L3-4 and in the neural foramina at L3-4 through L5-S1.     3.  Diffuse decreased marrow signal suggestive of marrow infiltrative process such as myelofibrosis or diffuse red marrow conversion in the setting of severe chronic anemia. Correlate clinically."

URGENT     COMPARISON: Previous x-ray May 2/17 (Hardisty Heatlh Centre).     TECHNIQUE: Routine non-augmented L-spine radiculopathy protocol.     FINDINGS:  5 lumbar type vertebral bodies are identified, as on prior plain radiograph. Conus medullaris is therefore noted to terminate normally at L1. There is limited visualization of the thoracolumbar junction. However, very minimal anterior wedging is seen. Schmorl's nodes are noted involving the superior and inferior endplates of T12, as well as the superior endplate of L1. This may relate to congenital Scheuermann's disease.     T11-12 demonstrates loss of disc height. Minimal posterior disc osteophyte complex is seen, along with mild degenerative facet joint change bilaterally. No stiffness stenosis results at this level.     T12-L1 demonstrates mild degenerative facet joint change bilaterally. No significant stenosis seen.     L1-2 and L2-3 are unremarkable, as assessed on sagittal sequences. No significant stenosis seen.     L3-4 demonstrates minimal degenerative facet joint change on the left. No stenosis seen at this level.     L4-5 demonstrates a small left paracentral disc protrusion and associated annular tear. T2 bright material is seen extending from the left paracentral annular tear inferior to the disc level. This extends into the right lateral recess measuring approximately 4 x 8 x 9 mm (AP x T x CC) in size. This is favored to represent sequelae of a sequestered disc fragment, and is compressing the traversing right L5 nerve root within the lateral recess. Mild degenerative facet joint changes are seen bilaterally. There is minimal stenosis of the left lateral recess also noted at this level. No other significant stenosis seen.     L5-S1 demonstrates a small central disc protrusion. In addition, there is a small 7 mm disc fragment seen to the right of midline just above this level. This is probably another small sequestered disc fragment. This may be coming from the L5-S1 disc, or possibly from the L4-5 disc above. In any event, this disc fragment is compressing the right L5 nerve root just prior to entering the right neural foramen. Mild degenerative facet joint changes are seen bilaterally. No other significant stenosis seen at this level.     IMPRESSION: Sequestered disc fragment within the right lateral recess at L4-5, probably arising from the L4-5 disc level. This is compressing the traversing right L5 nerve root. Additional sequestered disc fragment just inferior to this, also compressing the right L5 nerve root just before it enters the neural foramen at L5-S1."

Technique: Routine lumbar spine protocol is performed. Findings: Lumbar spine alignment is normal. Vertebral body heights are maintained. The conus medullaris and regia equina are normal. At the T12 - L1 level the disc is normal. The thecal sac and exiting nerve roots are free of compression. At the L1 - 2 level there is a small left paracentral disc protrusion which minimally compresses the anterior aspect of the thecal sac on the left. The exiting and transiting nerve roots are free of compression. At the L2 - 3 level there is some circumferential disc bulging causing minimal compression on the anterior aspect of the thecal sac. The exiting and transiting nerve roots are free of compression. At the L3 - 4 level there is circumferential disc bulging with a small right paracentral disc protrusion. There is minimal compression on the anterior aspect of the thecal sac and some mild supination recess stenosis is seen. There is some mild foraminal encroachment bilaterally but no definite exiting nerve root or transiting nerve root compressions are seen. Altogether then L4 - 5 level there is circumferential disc bulging with a small to moderate posterior midline disc protrusion with moderate severe facet joint osteoarthritis bilaterally. This causes mild central canal stenosis and moderate severe lateral recess stenosis bilaterally. The exiting nerve roots are free of compression. There is severe transiting nerve root compression bilaterally. At the L5 - S1 level there is circumferential disc bulging. There is a 14 x 9 x 12 mm mass identified inall the left lateral recess at the level of the L5 vertebral body likely representing extruded disc material however a neurofibroma or other neoplastic lesion would be in the differential diagnosis. Usually causes moderate compression of the left anterolateral aspect of the thecal sac. Certainly appears to be causing severe compression of our exiting left L5 nerve root as it enters the foramina. Transiting nerve roots remain free of compression. The exiting right nerve root is free of compression. There is severe facet joint osteoarthritis conjectured bilaterally. IMPRESSION: Multilevel degenerative disc changes with facet joint osteoarthritis at several levels. Masslike abnormality in the left lateral recess superior to the L5 - S1 disc space causing severe compression of the exiting left L5 nerve root. This most likely represents extruded disc material however a neoplastic lesion cannot be completely excluded. Further investigation with a contrast - enhanced study could be helpful.

The posterior longitudinal ligament appears to be expanded and is widened in the AP dimension from the   level of the top of C6 2 the upper third of the C7 vertebral body posteriorly.

I suspect that there is a small defect in the posterior longitudinal ligament allowing the focal herniation  to extend into/through the ligament with further extrusion in a superior and inferior direction at the posterior aspect of the   posterior longitudinal ligament this results in a posterior convexity indenting the cervical cord resulting in deformation of the   cord and some signal change within the substance of the cord in keeping with high-grade central canal stenosis.  Recommend urgent   neurosurgical opinion.    Alternatively, although much less likely, this could represent a focal disc as well as a intra-axial   lesion such as a meningioma.

The conus medullaris terminates appropriately at L1.  Vertebral body heights and bone marrow signal characteristics are normal, with Modic type II fatty signal changes noted in the endplates at L3-4 and L4-5.     High T1 and T2 signal is also noted in the discs at T12-L1, L1-2 and L5-S1 consistent with the presence of milk of calcium.  A linear T1/T2 signal void is also noted centrally within the L1-2 disc in keeping with vacuum phenomenon.     At T10-11, a small right paracentral disc protrusion mildly indents the ventral aspect of the thecal sac.

991,0,"TECHNIQUE: MRI of the lumbar spine was performed utilizing sagittal T1, T2, and STIR sequences through the entire lumbar spine, with axial T1 and T2 sequences through the lower 3 disc levels.     FINDINGS: Comparison is made to lumbar spine x-rays from October 07, 2019 and June 04, 2011.  These x-rays demonstrate 5 lumbar type vertebral bodies, as well as a cyst with a sclerotic margin along the posterior portion of the L4 vertebral body.     The MRI also demonstrates a cyst within the posterior aspect of the L4 vertebral body, along its left aspect.  This cyst measures 1.5 cm craniocaudad by 1 cm AP by 0.9 cm transverse, and appears stable when compared to the prior x-rays.  The MRI also demonstrates a low T1 and T2 signal intensity rim, consistent with the sclerosis on the x-rays.  This is associated with endplate irregularity along the superior aspect of the L4 vertebral body, which suggests that this is degenerative in etiology.  There is a small amount of fibrovascular endplate degenerative changes along the posterior left aspect of the L5-S1 level, preferentially involving the L5 endplate.  There is also evidence of extensive fatty endplate degenerative changes along the anterior aspect of the L4-L5 level.  Anterior osteophytes at multiple levels, preferentially at the L4-L5 level.     The visualized portion of the retroperitoneum is within normal limits.  The paraspinous musculature is unremarkable.  The conus medullaris is normal in appearance, and terminates normally at approximately the L1-L2 disc level.     The visualized portion of the lower thoracic spine and the upper lumbar spine demonstrate relatively normal discs, with no significant spinal canal/neural foraminal narrowing.     L3-L4: There is mild degenerative disc disease, with loss of normal disc signal, endplate irregularity, tiny anterior osteophytes, and subtle loss of disc height.  The cyst within the L4 vertebral body has been described previously.  There is also a tiny right foraminal disc protrusion that results in mild right inferior neural foraminal narrowing, but no evidence of compression of the exiting right L3 nerve root.  No significant spinal canal narrowing at this level.  No significant facet arthropathy.     L4-L5: There is moderate degenerative disc disease, with moderate loss of disc height, loss of disc signal, fatty endplate degenerative change, anterior osteophytes, and a mild diffuse disc bulge.  No significant facet arthropathy.  These findings result in minimal spinal canal narrowing, but no evidence of compression or displacement of the L5 nerve roots within the lateral recesses.  There is also evidence of mild bilateral inferior neural foraminal narrowing, but no evidence of compression of the exiting nerve roots.     L5-S1: There is mild to moderate degenerative disc disease, with preferential disc height loss along the left aspect of the disc level, where there is also a small amount of fibrovascular endplate degenerative change.  There is also loss of disc signal.  There is a mild disc bulge with a superimposed left paracentral disc protrusion.  No significant facet arthropathy or ligamentum flavum hypertrophy.  These findings result in left lateral recess narrowing with posterior displacement and mild flattening of the left S1 nerve root, concerning for compression.  Mild bilateral inferior neural foraminal narrowing, but no evidence of definitive compression of the exiting nerve roots.     IMPRESSION:     The L5-S1 level demonstrates mild to moderate degenerative disc disease, preferentially along the left aspect, where there is also left-sided fibrovascular endplate degenerative changes.  There is also a left paracentral disc protrusion at this level which results in posterior displacement and what appears to be mild compression of the left S1 nerve root within the lateral recess.  This could be a cause of the patient's left-sided symptoms.     2.          Moderate degenerative disc disease at the L4-L5 level, with associated fatty endplate degenerative changes and a mild diffuse disc bulge, but no significant spinal canal/neural foraminal narrowing.     3.          Mild degenerative disc disease at the L3-L4 level.  There are findings most suggestive of a degenerative endplate cyst arising off of the superior endplate of L4 and extending into the left/posterior aspect of the L4 vertebral body.  This is an unusual degenerative endplate finding, but the fact that the cyst was seen on the 2011 x-rays, and is grossly stable when compared to the prior x-rays, suggests that this is a benign finding.     The Workers' Compensation Board has requested that we provide a professional opinion as to whether the imaging findings are related whole or in part to the injury in question. This is not considered part of the official diagnostic imaging report, and will only be used to help a WCB caseworker decide whether the injury is work-related or not. My opinion is:  WCB Category - Some of the imaging findings could be related to the patient's injury."

1013,1,"MRI lumbar spine.     Comparison priors MRI of the lumbar spine from March 11, 2012     5 lumbar type vertebral bodies.  With this designation a normal conus medullaris is present at T12-L1.     There is normal alignment of the lumbar spine.  Slight decrease in generalized bone marrow signal with no focal bone lesion is likely hematopoietic in etiology.     At L4-5 there is a slight decrease in signal of the intervertebral disc, suggestive of a mild disc degeneration.  There is a focal central-left paracentral disc protrusion, with an associated 0.8 cm inferior extrusion of disc components.  In combination with mild facet joint arthropathy and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy this results in focal severe stenosis of the spinal canal and with narrowing of the left lateral recess.  Minimal narrowing of the right lateral recess.  The neural foramina are patent.     There is evidence of mild disc degeneration involving the other lumbar segments with a slight decrease in signal; however, demonstrating no significant disc herniation.

1020,0,"Reason for Exam: R/O CAUDA EQINA-SENSORY LOSS/PARESTHESIAS-C2           ******** ADDENDUM #1 ********     The CT chest from May 28, 2019 and CT abdomen/pelvis from May 29, 2019 (both performed at UAH) were reviewed. The multiple small lytic lesions with sclerotic rims scattered within the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae, sacrum and left and right ilium on the CT studies demonstrate subtle central hypointense T1 and heterogenous T2 signal. Some lesions have a subtle rim of T1 hyperintensity at their periphery. The MR appearance is nonspecific. Infectious, granulomatous and malignant etiologies would have to be considered in the differential. A PET/CT scan may be of benefit to determine if these lesions are metabolically active and assess for a potential site for biopsy.    HISTORY:   As above.     TECHNIQUE:   Large field-of-view sagittal T1 and T2 imaging of the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine was first obtained. Sagittal T2 imaging of the lumbar spine and axial T1 and T2 imaging from L2-3 to L5-S1 was then acquired.     FINDINGS:  Lumbar spine x-rays from May 2013 2019 (Grey Nuns Hospital), thoracic spine x-rays from May 9, 2019 (MIC Tawa Centre) and cervical spine x-rays from May 1, 2017 (Insight Medical Imaging) were reviewed.     CERVICAL SPINE:  Straightening of the cervical spine noted. Vertebral body heights are maintained. Prevertebral soft tissues, craniocervical junction and visualized posterior fossa structures are unremarkable. Marrow signal is unremarkable.     There is mild soft tissue prominence posterior to the odontoid, indenting the ventral thecal sac but not causing any spinal cord impingement. This is of doubtful significance. The odontoid itself is intact with no erosions or osseous destruction apparent. Atlanto-dental interval is normal.     The cervical spinal cord is normal. No spinal stenosis at any level.     Moderate disc space narrowing and small posterior disc-osteophyte complex noted at C5-6. This does not affect the spinal cord. Probable mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing at this level. NO significant degenerative changes in the remainder of the cervical spine.        THORACIC SPINE:  Alignment is unremarkable. Prevertebral soft tissues are unremarkable. Small Schmorl's nodes noted at some levels. No focal destructive osseous lesions.     Thoracic spinal cord and conus are normal. Conus terminates at the T12 level. No fatty filum terminale.     Small posterior disc-osteophyte complexes at the T7-8, T9-10, T10-11, T11-12 and T12-L1 levels indent the thecal sac but do not affect the spinal cord or exiting nerve roots. No significant spinal stenosis or neural foraminal stenosis at any level.        LUMBAR SPINE:  Five lumbar type vertebrae are present. There is ventral downsloping of the superior endplate of L1, which appears remote. There is mild downsloping of the superior endplate of L2 also, which also appears old. Heights of the other lumbar vertebral bodies are maintained. Moderately advanced degenerative endplate changes are present within the L3 and L4 vertebral bodies. Patchy fatty marrow within the L1 and L2 vertebral bodies and along the L5-S1 endplates is likely degenerative in etiology also.     At L1-2, there is mild loss of disc height. A small posterior disc bulge indents the thecal sac. There is no nerve root impingement or spinal stenosis. No significant neural foraminal narrowing.     At L2-3, disc height is preserved. There is diffuse hypointense T2 signal indicative of disc degeneration. A small annular disc bulge mildly indents the ventral thecal sac. There is no nerve root impingement, spinal stenosis or lateral recess narrowing. Mild bilateral facet degenerative changes.     At L3-4, there is moderate to severe loss of disc height eccentrically towards the right, associated with mild degenerative endplate changes and small anterior osteophytes. Mild bilateral facet degenerative changes and ligamentum flavum thickening noted. A small broad-based posterior disc-osteophyte complex indents the thecal sac and encroaches upon the inferior aspect of both neural foramina, more so on the right, resulting in moderate stenosis of the right neural foramen and mild narrowing of the left neural foramen. Slight narrowing of both lateral recesses noted. Slight transverse narrowing of the thecal sac but no significant spinal stenosis.     At L4-5, there is grade I anterolisthesis of 3 mm. This is likely secondary to moderate to severe bilateral facet arthropathy at this level, associated with thickening of the ligamentum flavum. Moderate-sized joint effusions noted bilaterally also. A broad-based posterior disc bulge indents the ventral thecal sac. There is an extradural lesion just above the disc level anterolaterally towards the left within the spinal canal, demonstrating heterogeneous T2 and hypointense T1 signal. This measures approximately 15 mm AP x 14 mm TR x 11 mm CC. Its etiology is unclear. It may represent an unusual perineural cyst, synovial cyst or chronic sequestered disc fragment. It compresses the thecal sac and effaces the left lateral recess, with the exiting left L4 nerve root stretched around it. Of note, this lesion was present in retrospect on a CT abdomen/pelvis study from July 5, 2017 (UAH), associated with some regional bony remodeling at that time, and similar in size. At the disc level, there   is severe stenosis of the left lateral recess, moderate narrowing of the right lateral recess, and moderate to severe spinal stenosis. Moderate to severe stenosis of the left neural foramen noted with effacement of the fat around the exiting left L4 nerve root. Mild narrowing of the right neural foramen. These findings are also similar to the 2017 CT study.     At L5-S1, there is mild loss of disc height posteriorly. There is a small shallow disc protrusion paracentrally on the left, abutting but not displacing the descending left S1 nerve root. Mild bilateral facet degenerative changes. Slight narrowing of the left lateral recess and moderate stenosis of the left neural foramen. No stenosis of the right lateral recess or right neural foramen. No spinal stenosis.     Visualized sacroiliac joints are unremarkable.     OPINION:  1. Normal spinal cord.     2. Mild degenerative changes of the cervical and thoracic spine.     3. Multilevel degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine. Unusual extradural lesion at the inferior L4 level anterolaterally towards the left, compressing the thecal sac and narrowing the left lateral recess. This is of uncertain etiology but appears grossly unchanged in size compared to a CT abdomen/pelvis study from 2017. Differential diagnosis includes a synovial cyst, atypical perineural cyst or chronic sequestered disc fragment.     4. Bilateral lateral recess stenoses (left greater than right), moderate to severe spinal stenosis and moderate to severe left neural foraminal stenosis at L4-5. Moderate stenosis of the left L5-S1 neural foramen. These findings are also similar to the 2017 CT examination."

SPINAL STENOSIS OR RADICULOPATHY           MRI LUMBAR SPINE     HISTORY: One-month history of pain radiating down posterior aspects of the legs with walking.  Query spinal stenosis or radiculopathy.     TECHNIQUE: Sagittal and axial T1 and T2 sequences of the lumbar spine.     COMPARISON: Lumbar spine x-rays February 8, 2021 (MIC).     FINDINGS: 5 lumbar type vertebrae are identified.  Mild chronic-appearing anterior height loss of T12 is observed.  Remaining vertebral body heights are normal.  Sagittal alignment of the lumbar spine is within normal limits.  Minor Modic type II signal alteration is seen throughout the imaged lower thoracic and lumbar spine anteriorly.  Type II Modic signal alteration is more extensive at L5-S1.  Marrow signal is otherwise unremarkable.  The conus medullaris terminates at the L2-3 level, within the lower limits of normal.  The imaged spinal cord is unremarkable.     T11-12 and T12-L1: Mild disc height loss with focal posterior disc protrusions.  No facet arthropathy.  Mild T11-12 spinal canal stenosis, with patent spinal canal at T12-L1.  Exit foramina through these levels are patent.  L1-2: Mild disc height loss with a circumferential disc bulge and posterior annular fissure.  No substantial facet arthropathy.  Spinal canal and exit foramina are patent.  L2-3: Minimal disc height loss with a mild circumferential disc bulge slightly more prominent to the left posterior region with a posterior annular fissure.  Mild bilateral facet arthropathy.  No spinal canal stenosis, though there is mild left lateral recess stenosis with contact but not distortion of the traversing left L3 nerve roots.  There is mild inferior narrowing of the left exit foramen.  The right exit foramen is patent.  L3-4: Mild disc height loss is seen, with a circumferential disc bulge.  Superimposed on this is a prominent posterior central disc protrusion.  Moderate bilateral facet arthropathy with ligamenta flava buckling is present.  There is resultant moderately severe spinal canal stenosis, with AP caliber of the spinal canal reduced to 5 mm, causing obliteration of the subarachnoid space and crowding of the cauda equina fibers to the point where individual fibers are not discernible.  There is definite impingement of the bilateral traversing L4 nerve roots.  Abnormalities at this level also result in mild inferior bilateral exit foraminal stenosis.  L4-5: Disc height is maintained, with a mild circumferential disc bulge.  Moderately severe bilateral facet arthropathy with ligamenta flava buckling is noted.  The spinal canal is patent.  There is mild inferior narrowing of the bilateral exit foramina.  L5-S1: Severe disc height loss is identified, with a circumferential disc osteophyte complex eccentric to the left.  Mild to moderate bilateral facet arthropathy is identified.  The spinal canal is patent, but there is moderate left subarticular recess stenosis with suspected contact but not distortion of the traversing left S1 nerve root.  Mild right and moderate left exit foraminal stenosis are also detected.     SUMMARY:  1.  Multilevel disc and facet degeneration is present as detailed above.  2.  Disc bulge with posterior central disc protrusion at L3-4 results in moderately severe spinal canal stenosis.  3.  Disc and facet degeneration cause moderate left subarticular recess stenosis at L5-S1, with contact but not distortion of the traversing left S1 nerve root.  4.  Disc and facet degeneration cause left exit foraminal stenosis at L5-S1.

1052,0,"MRI LUMBAR SPINE  MRI SACROILIAC JOINTS  TECHNIQUE: Sagittal T1, T2, and STIR sequences were obtained through the entire  lumbar spine, with axial T1 and T2 sequences through the lower 3 disc levels. Oblique  coronal T1, STIR, T1 fat saturation and oblique axial T2 fat saturation sequences were  obtained through the sacroiliac joints.  FINDINGS: The lumbar spine x-rays from December 05, 2019 demonstrate 5 lumbar  type vertebral bodies.  There is a normal lordotic curvature and alignment of the lumbar spine. Vertebral body  heights are well-maintained, with a tiny amount of bone marrow edema involving the  right L5-S1 endplates, consistent with fibrovascular endplate degenerative change.  The visualized portion of the retroperitoneum is within normal limits. The paraspinous  musculature is unremarkable. The conus medullaris is normal in appearance, and  terminates normally at approximately the L1 level.  The visualized portion of the lower thoracic spine and the upper lumbar spine  demonstrates normal discs, with no evidence of spinal canal/neural foraminal  narrowing.  L3-L4: Unremarkable.  L4-L5: There is mild degenerative disc disease, with mild loss of disc height, loss of  disc signal, and a mild diffuse disc bulge with a tiny superimposed left paracentral disc  protrusion and annular tear. Unremarkable facet joints. These findings result in  minimal narrowing of both lateral recesses, left greater than right, but no evidence of  compression or displacement of either L5 nerve root. No significant neural foraminal narrowing.  L5-S1: There is mild degenerative disc disease, with mild loss of disc height and subtle  loss of disc signal. There is a large right paracentral/foraminal disc extrusion, which  extends superior to the inferior endplate of L5 by 1 cm (sequence 2 image 5 the disc  extrusion measures approximately 2 cm transverse (sequence 5 image 19).  Unremarkable facet joints. The disc extrusion results in marked narrowing of the right  lateral recess, with inward displacement of the right S1 nerve root as well as mild  flattening of this nerve root, concerning for compression. There is also right inferior  neural foraminal narrowing, with the disc extrusion abutting the inferior aspect of the  exiting right L5 nerve root, also concerning for mild compression.  Right sacroiliac joint: No evidence of joint space widening, narrowing, or ankylosis. No  evidence of bone marrow edema, erosions, or fatty marrow change. No evidence of a  joint effusion or surrounding soft tissue edema.  Left sacroiliac joint: No evidence of joint space widening, narrowing, or ankylosis. No  evidence of bone marrow edema, erosions, or fatty marrow change. No evidence of a  joint effusion or surrounding soft tissue edema.  IMPRESSION:  1. Mild degenerative disc disease at the L5-S1 level, with a large right  paracentral/foraminal disc protrusion and a small amount of right-sided fibrovascular  endplate degenerative change. The disc extrusion results in inward displacement  and possible mild compression of the right S1 nerve root within the lateral recess.  There is also right inferior neural foraminal narrowing, with possible mild  compression of the exiting right L5 nerve root. These findings are likely causing the patient's right-sided back pain.  2.

There is lumbosacral transitional anatomy.  The prior lumbar spine radiograph demonstrates 6 nonrib-bearing lumbar vertebrae with complete lumbarization of S1.  For the purposes of today's study, the most well formed inferior disc space will be denoted as S1-S2.     LUMBAR SPINE:     Lumbosacral alignment is unremarkable.     Normal lumbar lordosis.  Small intervertebral hemangioma in L2.     There is mild loss of the intranuclear T2 signal of the L5-S1 and S1-S2 disc reflecting mild degenerative disc disease.  Disc heights spaces are preserved.  Vertebral body morphology is preserved.     The conus medullaris terminates at T12-L1 and demonstrates a normal appearance.  The cauda equina nerve roots are unremarkable.     T12-L3: Unremarkable.        Axial sequences were obtained from L4 to S2.     L4-L5: Unremarkable.     L5-S1: There is a very small central disc bulge with a thin linear area of increased T2 signal in the posterior aspect of the disc likely reflecting a posterior annular fissure.  No significant central canal or neural foraminal stenosis.  The facet joints appear unremarkable.     S1-S2: Small posterior disc bulge.  No significant central canal or neural foraminal stenosis.  The facet joints are unremarkable.     There is a large Tarlov cyst within the right S2 neural foramen measuring 2.5 x 1.8 x 2.4 cm which is seen to anterolaterally displace and compress the exiting right S2 nerve root within the neural foramen.  Multiple smaller left-sided Tarlov cysts are noted involving the left S1 and S2 level.  The left S2 nerve root though appears unremarkable throughout its course.     The anterior and posterior paraspinal soft tissues are unremarkable.        SACROILIAC JOINTS:     The sacroiliac joint spaces are preserved.  There is surface cortical irregularity as well as subchondral signal abnormality involving the anterior aspect of the sacroiliac joints predominantly along the iliac portion were there is mild focal subchondral bone marrow edema.  No definite erosions.  No ankylosis.  No joint effusion.     No fatty metaplasia.     Overlying soft tissues are unremarkable.     There is a functional follicle in the right adnexa measuring 2.6 x 1.4 cm.  A physiologic sliver of fluid is noted in the pelvis.     The endometrium is unremarkable for the age of the patient.     A small intraosseous cyst is noted in the left femoral head neck junction of the left hip.        CONCLUSION:     The prior thoracic spine radiograph demonstrates 12 rib-bearing thoracic vertebrae.

Vertebral body heights are maintained.  No acute compression fractures.  Conus terminates at approximately L1, within normal limits.  Patchy heterogenous marrow signal, similar to previous.     T12-L1: No spinal canal stenosis.     L-1-L2: No spinal canal stenosis.  Disc height is maintained.     L2-L3: Moderate disc space narrowing.  Posterior disc osteophyte complex eccentric to the left abuts the ventral thecal sac and results in mild narrowing of the left lateral recess.  No significant spinal canal stenosis.  The right neural foramina is patent.  Disc material extends into inferior left neural foramina resulting in mild/moderate stenosis.  Mild left facet arthropathy.     L3-L4: Severe loss of disc height.  Small posterior disc osteophyte complex abuts the ventral thecal sac.  In conjunction with ligamentum flavum hypertrophy, mild spinal canal stenosis.  Mild left and mild right neural foraminal stenosis.  Mild bilateral facet arthropathy, more so on the left.     L4-L5: Grade 1 anterolisthesis by 3 mm, unchanged.  Disc desiccation and minor loss of disc height.  Circumferential broad-based disc bulging.  In conjunction with ligamentum flavum hypertrophy, resultant mild spinal canal stenosis.  Mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing.  Mild to moderate bilateral facet arthropathy.     L5-S1: Severe loss of intervertebral disc height.  Small posterior disc osteophyte complex which abuts the ventral thecal sac.  No significant spinal canal stenosis.  Moderate bilateral facet hypertrophic changes.  The findings results in moderate right-sided neural foraminal narrowing, and mild to moderate left neural foraminal narrowing.     The known complex cystic structure within the left adnexa is not completely imaged.  This was better characterized on the MRI pelvis from January 12, 2016.  Measures at least 5.7 cm.     IMPRESSION:  1. Multilevel degenerative changes, overall fairly similar to prior MRI from 2015.

At L5-S1, there is again severe degenerative disc disease and moderate right neural foraminal narrowing with possible involvement of the exiting L5 nerve root.     2. Heterogenous marrow signal is again noted and similar dating back to 2015.  Given the negative bone scan from 2015/ relative long-term stability, findings would suggest a benign process.     3.

COMPARISON: Lumbar radiographs from April 2, 2016.     FINDINGS:     There are 5 lumbar type vertebrae. Mild degenerative retrolisthesis of L2 on L3, L3 on L4, and L5 on S1. Vertebral body heights are overall preserved with no significant vertebral compression fracture. Modic type endplate changes at multiple levels and a few small Schmorl's nodes, the largest in the inferior endplate of L2. No aggressive bone marrow signal. The conus medullaris terminates normally at the L1-L2 intervertebral level. The visualized spinal cord and intervertebral discs are normal in signal intensity.     At T11-T12, moderate/severe disc height loss with disc ossification and anterior osteophytes. Tiny posterior disc bulge. No spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis.

1091,0,"MR CERVICAL SPINE:    ‚   History: New onset of neck pain with abrupt left C5 decrease in motor function. CT shows high-grade spinal stenosis at C4-C5    ‚   Protocol: Routine sequences including sagittal T2, sagittal T1, axial T2 and axial MEDIC.    ‚   FINDINGS:    ‚   Straightening of the cervical spine is seen along its length which is nonspecific but quite likely positional. Study includes   evaluation from the base of the skull through the mid T5 level.    ‚   Craniocervical alignment is normal and assessment of the C1-C2 level is normal.    ‚   C2-3: At C2-C3, disc height is maintained. No other vertebral osteophytosis is present. No significant facet degeneration is seen  at the level and no focal neurologic compromise is evident.    ‚   C3-4: At C3-C4, there is marked disc space narrowing with anterior osteophytes and small uncovertebral osteophytes. There is   moderate left facet degeneration and mild right facet degeneration. This is associated with a degenerative spondylolisthesis of C3  on C4 with 3 mm of anterior motion. No significant central stenosis is present and the level and the foramina are still preserved   bilaterally.    ‚   C4-5: At C4-C5, there is marked narrowing of the disc space. Both anterior and bilateral uncovertebral osteophytosis is present   and a minor concentric bulge is posterior osteophytes are noted. Intervertebral foramina are widely preserved. Narrowing of the   central canal to and AP diameter of 7-8 mm is noted and slight flattening of the cord is noted at the level. There is foraminal   narrowing bilaterally at the level which I believe to be moderate in severity.    ‚   C5-6: At C5-C6, there is moderate to marked disc space narrowing. Small posterior and bilateral uncovertebral osteophytes are   present in the uncovertebral osteophytes are little more pronounced on the left than they are on the right. Intervertebral   foramina are preserved. Narrowing of the AP diameter of the canal to 6 mm is noted. Flattening of the cord is noted at the level.   Mild narrowing of the left intervertebral foramen is noted while the right-sided foramen is widely patent.    ‚   C6-7: At C6-C7 there is moderate to marked disc space narrowing and again there is anterior and bilateral uncovertebral   osteophytosis as well as small posterior osteophytes and a minor concentric bulge.

TECHNIQUE: Routine MRI lumbar spine (sagittal T2, sagittal T1, sagittal STIR, axial T2/T1).  COMPARISON: Radiograph January 27, 2020.  FINDINGS: 5 lumbar-type vertebral bodies are assumed. The vertebral body heights are maintained.  Conus medullaris terminates approximately at L1, within normal limits. Abnormal marrow signal.  Heterogeneous patchy decreased T1/T2 signal is seen throughout the spine. No acute compression  fracture is identified.  Multilevel disc desiccation, extending from L1 to S1.  T12-L1: No spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis.  L1-L2: There is mild circumferential disc bulging. There is no spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis.  L2-L3: No spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis.  L3-L4: There is mild circumferential disc bulging. There is no spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis.  Minor facet arthropathy.  L4-L5: Broad based circumferential disc bulging. A small right superimposed lateral recess/foraminal zone  disc extrusion is noted. The extruded disc material contacts the traversing right L5 nerve root within the  lateral recess, with possible impingement in region of the ligamentum flavum.  Disc material also possibly contacts the traversing left L5 nerve root, without evidence of impingement.    There is mild ligamentum flavum hypertrophy and mild facet arthropathy. No significant spinal canal  stenosis. Mild right neural foraminal narrowing. Left neural foramen is patent.  L5-S1: Severe disc space narrowing. Small broad based disc osteophyte complex which abuts the ventral  thecal sac. No significant resultant spinal canal stenosis. Mild bilateral facet arthropathy. Mild-moderate  right and mild-moderate left neural foraminal stenosis.  There is a T1 hyperintense-T2 hypointense triangular shaped focus along the posterolateral aspect of the  midpole right kidney measuring approximately 1.4 x 1.4 cm (TR/AP). This could represent a focus of  cortical scarring.  IMPRESSION:  1. At L4-L5, broad based disc bulging with superimposed small right paracentral disc protrusion which  results in narrowing of the right lateral recess. Disc material contacts and possibly impinges the traversing  right L5 nerve root in the lateral recess, near region of the ligamentum flavum.  2. At L5-S1, severe degenerative disc disease with no significant spinal canal stenosis. Mild-to-moderate  bilateral neural foraminal stenosis.  3. No severe spinal canal stenosis in the lumbar spine.  4. Abnormal marrow signal. There is heterogeneous diffuse replacement of normal fatty marrow signal.  Findings are not entirely specific and may be secondary to a number of different etiologies including  leukemia/lymphoma, myeloma, or diffuse metastases. Review of Netcare notes that a flow cytometry  performed on October 19, 2017 demonstrates findings consistent with T-cell large granular lymphocytic  leukemia. Findings, thus, can be secondary to leukemia. Clinical correlation is advised.  5. There is a small T1 hyperintense/T2 hypointense focus along the posterolateral aspect of the midpole right kidney. Differential considerations include a hemorrhagic/proteinaceous cyst, or possibly a focus of cortical scarring. This is, however, incompletely characterized."
1093,1,"FINDINGS: Minimal likely fibronodular changes at the lung apices.  Limited assessment of the imaged portions of the intracranial structures appear unremarkable.  A few small T2 hyperintense likely cystic areas are noted within the region of the nasopharynx, the largest  measuring up to 5 mm, the overall appearance is similar when compared to previous and favored to be  related to mucus retention cysts.  Increased T2 hyperintensity within the spinal cord at the T4-T5 level, findings favored to be related to  minimal hydrosyringomyelia measuring up to 1 mm in thickness and slightly more conspicuous when  compared to the prior examination.  Mild degenerative disc disease of the cervical spine, most severe from C4 until C7.  Minimal type 2 Modic changes at the endplates of the cervical spine, favored to be relatedto  degenerative changes.  Axial images were obtained from C2 until superior T6 vertebral body level.

Mild to moderate spondylotic changes of the cervical spine, similar to marginally worsened when  compared to previous and most severe at the C5-C6 level where there is mild to moderate central canal  stenosis and moderate to severe bilateral foraminal stenosis. Multilevel changes as described above.  2. Minimal hydrosyringomyelia suspected at the T4-T5 level measuring up to 1 mm in thickness, appears  marginally more conspicuous when compared to previous, nonspecific, could be related to multiple  etiologies including congenital, posttraumatic, secondary to degenerative changes among other  considerations.  3. Findings favored to be related to mucus retention cysts within the nasopharynx, the appearance is similar when compared to previous.  Additional findings as detailed above.  The Workers' Compensation Board has requested that we provide a professional opinion as to whether  the imaging findings are related in whole or in part to the injury in question. This is not considered part of  the official diagnostic imaging report, and will only be used to help a WCB caseworker decide whether  the injury is work-related or not. My opinion is:  Some of the imaging findings could be related to the patient's injury."
1094,0,"This report assumes five lumbar type vertebrae.  A subtle kyphotic deformity is noted at the T12/L1 level.  The vertebral body heights are well-maintained.  The bone marrow signal is fairly homogeneous allowing for hemangiomata/fatty rests as well as degenerative endplate changes at several levels.  The conus medullaris terminates normally at approximately the L1 level.     At the L5/S1 level, subtle degenerative endplate changes and narrowing of the intervertebral disc is present.  A defect is suspected within the pars interarticularis bilaterally at the L5 level, more striking on the right side.

A small amount of vacuum phenomenon is present within the intervertebral disc.  Disc/osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline, which extends laterally, protruding into the inferior aspect of the neural foramen bilaterally.  A superimposed tiny disc protrusion is suspected posteriorly straddling the midline, which appears to contact but not significantly displace or compress the traversing left L5 nerve root.  Minor degenerative change is present involving the facet joints.  The findings are resulting in mild neural foraminal compromise bilaterally.  No significant compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.     At the L3/4 level, subtle degenerative endplate changes are present along with mild narrowing of the intervertebral disc.  Mild disc/osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline which extends laterally protruding into the inferior aspect of the neural foramen bilaterally.  The posterior disc/osteophyte complex appears to contact but not significantly displace or compress the traversing L4 nerve root bilaterally.  Minor degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints.  The findings are resulting in minimal/mild neural foraminal compromise bilaterally.  No significant compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.     At the L2/3 level, subtle degenerative endplate changes and narrowing of the intervertebral disc is present.  Minor disc/osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline which extends laterally protruding into the region of the neural foramen bilaterally.  A minuscule focus of abnormal increased T2 signal is present within the disc annulus posteriorly in the midline compatible with an annular fissure.  No significant neural foraminal compromise or compromise of the adjacent thecal sac is appreciated.     To the extent visualized, the L1/2 level is unremarkable.     At the T12/L1 level, subtle degenerative endplate changes and mild narrowing of the intervertebral disc is present.  Minor disc/osteophyte complex is suspected posteriorly.

No significant neural foraminal compromise or compromise of the thecal sac/spinal canal is appreciated.  Bilateral spondylolysis is suspected at the L5 level along with a subtle anterolisthesis of the body of L5 with respect to the body of S1 as detailed above.  A tiny disc protrusion is present posteriorly straddling the midline at the L4/5 level which appears to contact the traversing left L5 nerve root.  Disc/osteophyte complex is present posteriorly at the L3/4 level which appears to contact the traversing L4 nerve root bilaterally.  Clinical correlation is essential."
1095,0,TECHNIQUE: Routine lumbar spine protocol.     FINDINGS:  5 lumbar type vertebra are assumed to be present.  Based on this the conus ends at the T12-L1 disc level and is unremarkable.     Axial and sagittal imaging is performed from T12-L1 through to L5-S1.     T12-L1: Intervertebral disc is dehydrated with mild loss of disc height.  There is minimal posterior midline disc bulging with minor indentation of thecal sac.  The neuroforamina remain patent.  Canal remains capacious.     L1-2: Intervertebral disc is dehydrated.  Some subtle posterior disc bulging with no significant compromise of canal.  Neuroforamina remain patent.     L2-3: Intervertebral disc is dehydrated.  Mild left-sided disc bulging with some mild encroachment inferior aspect of the left neural foramen.  The exiting nerve root is not impinged.  The right neural foramen is unremarkable.     L3-4: Intervertebral disc is dehydrated.  Minimal left-sided disc bulging with no significant compromise of the neural foramen.  Right neural foramen is unremarkable.     L4-5: Intervertebral disc is dehydrated.  Minimal posterior disc bulging with only minor ventral indentation of thecal sac.     There is bilateral facet joint osteoarthritis with facet hypertrophy.  Joint effusions are present.  There is also ligamentum flavum thickening.  Arising from the right facet joint there is a small 3 mm synovial cyst.  The combination with mild bulging and the facet overgrowth and ligamentum flavum thickening and small right-sided synovial cyst results in impingement on the thecal sac with some mild narrowing of lateral recesses.  There is mild impingement of the descending right L5 nerve root.     L5-S1: Intervertebral disc is dehydrated with moderate loss of disc height.  Anterior vertebral osteophyte formation.  There is mild posterior generalized disc bulging.  This does not result in any compromise of the thecal sac but there is some mild encroachment into inferior aspects off the neural foramina bilaterally.  On the right side the exiting L5 nerve root appears to contact the disc and osteophyte margin.  On the left side there appears to be a thin fat plane maintained.     The vertebral body alignment is normal.  The vertebral body heights are maintained.  There is generalized mild to moderate fatty atrophy of the erector spinae musculature.     SUMMARY:     Multiple level degenerative disc disease as described.  Facet joint osteoarthritis at L4-5.     The most significant level appears to be at L4-5 where there is moderate narrowing of the canal diameter.  Mild impingement of the descending right L5 nerve root.  The right L5 nerve root also appears to contact the disc margin as it exits at the L5-S1 neural foramen.  This has potential for symptomatology.

1105,0,"PROCEDURE NAME(S):    MR T-SPINE NO CONTRAST    HISTORY:   INCIDENTAL FINDING OF PROLAPSED   CALCIFIED T 9/10 DISC W/ CORD COMPRESSION                             Correlation is made to CT dated December 19, 2019.          TECHNIQUE:    Sagittal T1/T2/STIR; axial T2.          FINDINGS:    There is normal alignment of the thoracic spine. Vertebral body heights are preserved. There are multilevel mild to moderate   degenerative endplate changes with loss of intervertebral disc heights in association. Scattered vertebral body hemangiomata   noted.       At T9/10, there is a focal partially calcified posterior disc extrusion measuring 8 mm AP and up to 15 mm transverse. Extruded   disc material measures 13 mm in total craniocaudal dimension, extending approximately 5 mm superior to the inferior T9 endplate   and approximately 4 mm inferior to the superior T10 endplate. This causes posterior displacement and anterior   flattening/indentation of the spinal cord with subtle increased intrasubstance cord T2 signal at this level. The central canal   measures 6 mm AP at the level of the extrusion.       There are further shallower posterior disc protrusions seen elsewhere within the thoracic spine. At T5/6, there is a right   parasagittal broad-based disc protrusion which just indents the right anterolateral margin of the cord and causes mild leftward   deviation of the cord without any convincing intrinsic cord signal abnormality at this level. This disc protrusion measures 8 mm   AP and extends superior to the inferior T5 endplate by approximately 6 mm. Further shallow noncompressive posterior disc   protrusions at T7/T8 and T2/T3 noted.       No significant central canal stenosis demonstrated elsewhere throughout the thoracic spine. No significant thoracic neural   foraminal stenosis.       The remainder of the imaged spinal cord and conus medullaris is unremarkable.       CONCLUSION:    Prominent central disc extrusion at T9/10 causing significant central canal stenosis, flattening/indentation of the spinal cord   and subtle localized intrinsic cord signal abnormality as described, compatible with myelopathic change at this level. A spinal   surgical consult is advised for further management.       Degenerative changes and further noncompressive disc protrusions elsewhere throughout the thoracic spine as described.         "

1135,1,"Technical:      Sagittal T1, sagittal T2, axial T2, and axial 3-D MEDIC sequences were performed.      FINDINGS:      Reversal of the normal cervical lordosis is present centered at the C4/5 level. Fairly advanced vertebral body height loss is present at the C4 level along with moderate vertebral body height loss at the C3 and C5 levels and mild vertebral body height loss at the C6 level, all of which appear chronic. Otherwise, to the extent visualized, the vertebral body heights are well-maintained. Mild degenerative change is present involving the predental space. Small anterior osteophytes are present extending from the C3/4 level superiorly down through the C6/7 level inferiorly. The cerebellar tonsils appear normal with respect to position.      At the C2/3 level, the intervertebral disc is unremarkable. The neural foramina appear patent.      At the C3/4 level, fairly prominent degenerative endplate changes are present. Degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints which results in an anterolisthesis of the body of C3 with respect to the body of C4 which measures approximately 5 to 6 mm with associated uncovering of the posterior aspect of the intervertebral disc. Disc/osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline which along with hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum results in mild compression of the adjacent thecal sac/spinal cord. Subtle focal abnormal increased T2 signal is present within the adjacent spinal cord compatible with edematous change. Degenerative change is present involving the uncovertebral joint bilaterally. The findings are resulting in fairly advanced neural foraminal compromise bilaterally.      At the C4/5 level, degenerative endplate changes are present along with moderate narrowing of the intervertebral disc. Degenerative change is present involving the facet joints which results in an anterolisthesis of the body of C4 with respect to the body of C5 measuring approximately 3 mm with associated uncovering of the posterior aspect of the intervertebral disc. A tiny disc protrusion is present posteriorly, straddling the midline but slightly more prominent to the left of midline, which appears to abut but not significantly compress the ventral surface of the adjacent spinal cord. Degenerative changes are present involving the uncovertebral joint bilaterally. The findings are resulting in moderate compromise of the left neural foramen and mild compromise of the right neural foramen.      At the C5/6 level, degenerative endplate changes are present along with moderate to advanced narrowing of the intervertebral disc. A small amount of vacuum phenomenon is suspected within the intervertebral disc. Degenerative change is present involving the facet joints which appears to result in a subtle retrolisthesis of the body of C5 with respect to the body of C6 which measures approximately 2 mm. Disc/osteophyte complex is present posteriorly, straddling the midline, which narrows the ventral subarachnoid space. Degenerative change is present involving the uncovertebral joint bilaterally, more prominent on the right side. The findings are resulting in severe compromise of the right neural foramen and at least moderate compromise of the left neural foramen.      At the C6/7 level, degenerative endplate changes are present along with moderate-to-advanced narrowing of the intervertebral disc. Mild disc/osteophyte complex is present posteriorly straddling the midline, which narrows the ventral subarachnoid space. Degenerative changes are present involving the uncovertebral and facet joints bilaterally, more prominent on the right side. The findings are resulting in moderate compromise of the right neural foramen and mild compromise of the left neural foramen.      At the C7/T1 level, subtle degenerative endplate changes are present. Mild degenerative changes are present involving the facet joints. The findings are resulting in minimal compromise of the left neural foramen. The right neural foramen is patent.      The remainder of the visualized levels are unremarkable.      To the extent visualized, the soft tissues of the neck are unremarkable. Patchy abnormal increased T2 signal is present centrally within the pons which is nonspecific but may simply reflect small-vessel ischemic changes, especially if the patient has a history of hypertension and/or diabetes.      IMPRESSION:      Vertebral body height loss is present at the C3, C4, C5, and C6 levels, with associated kyphotic deformity. Superimposed degenerative change is present involving the intervertebral disc as well as the uncovertebral and facet joints, resulting in neural foraminal compromise at multiple levels (most striking bilaterally at the C3/4 level) as well as at least mild compression of the thecal sac/spinal cord at the C3/4 level as discussed. Additionally, subtle focal abnormal increased T2 signal is present within the spinal cord at the C3/4 level compatible with edematous change. A fairly urgent surgical consultation is advised."

This appears more   pronounced on the left.       C2-3: No further patent.       C3-4: Severe left neural foraminal narrowing related to uncovertebral/facet joint hypertrophic change plus minus disc bulge.    Moderate right neural foraminal narrowing.       C4-5: Up to moderate left neural foraminal narrowing related to the same.       C5-6: Mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing related to the same.       C6-7: The right neural foramen there is a 7 x 4 mm area of increased T2 signal.       C7-T1: There are some tiny cystic areas near the level of the neural foramina bilaterally and is likely related to some small   perineural cysts.       IMPRESSION:       Severe left neural foraminal narrowing at C3-4 is multifactorial.  Moderate right neural foraminal narrowing at this level.       Moderate left neural foraminal narrowing at C4-5.       Within the right C6-7 neural foramen, there appears to be a cystic area.  This may related be related to facet cyst as compared   to perineural cyst and could potentially be causing impingement upon the foramen."
1155,0,"MR spine technique: Sagittal T1 and STIR of the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine.      COMPARISON: MR lumbar spine 24 August, 2019.      FINDINGS:   Counting from C2 down there is normal segmentation with 5 mobile type lumbar vertebral bodies.      MR from August 2019 demonstrated compression fracture of the inferior L3 and superior L4 endplates with edema is present through the L4 vertebral body. This edema has resolved with no significant residual edema within the L3 or L3-4 vertebral bodies.      Remote compression fracture of the T12 vertebral body is unchanged from August 2019.      Degenerative changes of the cervical spine with reversal of lordosis at C3-C6. Some C4-C5 disc osteophyte slightly indenting the cord and flavum hypertrophy at C5-C6 indenting the cord. No definite compression of the cord and cord signal intensities appear normal.         IMPRESSION:   The fractures of the L3 and L4 vertebral bodies demonstrated on the MR from August 2019 have now healed with persistent height loss.    No new or ongoing compression fractures."
1156,0,"MRI lumbar spine      History: LONG STANDING MID AND LOWER BACKPAIN, ASSOCIATED WITH NUMBESS, TINGLING ALL THE XRAY TO BOTH LEGS.     Technique: Sagittal and transverse T1 and T2     FINDINGS:  The radiographs of December 8, 2016 show 5 lumbar type vertebrae. As on those films there is normal alignment with no anterolisthesis. The vertebral body heights are preserved. Multiple Schmorl nodes are present. Multilevel disc height loss, desiccation and posterior bulge are present. There are annular tears at L4-5, L3-4, and T12-L1 as seen on November 24, 2017. The conus is at L1 to. The filum terminalis is not fatty. As noted in 2017 the spinal canal is slightly developmentally narrow diffusely.     L5-S1: Prominent left and mild right facet hypertrophy, with disc bulge eccentric to the right and bulky endplate osteophytes. There is left foraminal encroachment. Epidural fat narrows the spinal canal mildly. Appearance is similar to 2017.     L4-5: Prominent bilateral facet hypertrophy with increased osteophyte formation posteriorly since 2017. Prominent epidural sat is again seen. Concentric disc bulge, facet hypertrophy and epidural fat narrows the spinal canal with crowding of nerve roots but CSF is not fully effaced. Left foraminal encroachment. Findings remain similar to 2017.     L3-4: Facet hypertrophy, disc bulge, epidural fat proud to the nerve roots in spinal canal without full effacement of CSF. There is left foraminal stenosis and right foraminal encroachment. Similar to 2017.     L2-3: Mild facet hypertrophy and disc bulge, no stenosis.  L1-2: Mild facet hypertrophy and disc bulge, no stenosis.     OPINION:  Multilevel degenerative changes, most prominently exuberant and progressive bilateral L4-5 facet hypertrophy. Facet steroid injection might be of value.  Chronic spinal canal narrowing from L3-4 to L5-S1 partially contributed to by epidural lipomatosis. This does not quite meet criteria for central spinal stenosis.  Chronic multilevel left-sided foraminal narrowing, with frank stenosis at L3-4."
1157,1,"Reason for Exam: FOOT DROP ON RIGHT.  ASSESS FOR SEQUESTERED DISC, L5-S1 LOCATION, RIGHT.     TECHNIQUE:  Sagittal T1 and sagittal T2-weighted imaging of the lumbar spine was performed with axial T1/T2 weighted imaging from L3 to S1/2.     Correlation is made to prior imaging, the most recent radiographs performed on 7 August 2018 and  the most recent MRI study performed on 16 October 2009.     FINDINGS:  5 lumbar-type vertebrae are noted. Endplate degenerative changes are noted at L4/5 and L5/S1. There is otherwise normal alignment of the vertebral bodies and facet joints with no significant loss in vertebral body height. T2 hyperintense focus within the left L1 pedicle with some T1 hyperintense signal within the periphery of the T2 hyperintensity may relate to an underlying hemangioma.     The conus medullaris terminates at the level of L1 and is within normal limits in appearance.     L1/2: No significant degenerative disc changes, spinal canal narrowing or neural foraminal narrowing.     L2/3: No significant degenerative disc changes, spinal canal narrowing or neural foraminal narrowing.     L3/4: No significant degenerative disc changes, spinal canal narrowing or neural foraminal narrowing.     L4/5: Moderate right central/subarticular disc extrusion extending inferiorly is now noted most likely compressing the traversing right L5 nerve root.

1158,0,"CLINICAL HISTORY: Worsening radiculopathy type pain radiating from left neck to left shoulder and arm, with numbness and tingling weakness.      TECHNIQUE: MRI of the cervical spine was performed with sagittal T1 and T2 sequences through the entire cervical spine as well as axial medic 3-D T2 sequences from C2-C3 to C7-T1.      COMPARISON: No relevant prior MRI. Radiographs of the cervical spine from 11 May, 2020.      FINDINGS:      Normal curvature and alignment of the cervical spine. Vertebral bodies are normal in height without evidence of fracture. No significant bone marrow signal abnormality.      There is an intramedullary cervical cord lesion at the level of C2 to the left of midline anterolaterally, measuring approximately 4 x 4 x 5 mm (AP x TR x CC). This lesion is occult on T1 weighted sequences, demonstrating isointense to mildly increased T2 signal intensity centrally compared to adjacent cord, with surrounding peripheral T2 hypointense rim. The T2 hypointense rim is even darker on axial T2 medic sequences.      No additional spinal cord lesion identified within the cervical and visualized upper thoracic cord. No hydrosyringomyelia.      Prevertebral cervical and paraspinal soft tissues are within normal limits. Visualized intracranial contents, posterior fossa and craniocervical junction are unremarkable.      Degenerative disease:      Atlantoaxial and atlantooccipital joints are intact without significant degenerative change. At C2-3, C6-7, and C7-T1 there is no large disc bulge or protrusion. No significant spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis at these levels. Vertebral bodies and intervertebral disc spaces of the visualized upper thoracic spine are unremarkable.      At C3-4, small posterior disc osteophyte complex and uncovertebral hypertrophy effaces the ventral CSF space and results in mild narrowing of the spinal canal. Minimal bilateral facet degeneration. No neural foraminal stenosis.      At C4-5, minor posterior disc osteophyte complex and uncovertebral hypertrophy results in mild spinal canal stenosis. Minimal bilateral facet degeneration. No neural foraminal stenosis.      At C5-6, large left paracentral and medial foraminal soft disc protrusion severely narrows the left lateral recess and neural foramina, and may contact the exiting left C5 nerve root. Mild spinal canal stenosis. Minimal bilateral facet degeneration.      IMPRESSION:      Tiny solitary intramedullary cervical cord lesion to the left of midline anterolaterally at C2, demonstrating signal characteristics typical of cavernous malformation. Attempt will be made to have the patient recalled for gadolinium enhanced MRI of the cervical spine to exclude the low likelihood of enhancement.      Large left paracentral and medial foraminal disc protrusion at C5-6 severely narrows the left lateral recess and neural foramina, and may compress the exiting left C6 nerve root."
